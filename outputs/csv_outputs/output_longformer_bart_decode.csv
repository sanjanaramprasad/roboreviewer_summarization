0,caring for people in acute day hospitals is as effective as inpatient care in treating acutely ill psychiatric patients. however further data are still needed on the cost effectiveness of day hospitals.,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of day hospital care in the treatment of people with schizophrenia., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of any of the interventions reviewed in this review. further well-designed and reported trials are needed to establish the effectiveness and safety of interventions for acute mental illness. such trials should be conducted in low-income countries where there is a need for high-quality trials to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions to improve quality of life in acute mental illnesses.
1,two trials are included in this review but no conclusions can be drawn for the benefit of co-acupressure for slowing progress of myopia in children. further evidence in the form of rcts are needed before any recommendations can be made for the use of acupuncture treatment in clinical use. these trials should compare acupuncture to placebo and have large sample sizes. other types of acupuncture such as auricular acupuncture should be explored further as well as compliance with treatment for at least six months or longer. axial length elongation of the eye should be investigated for at least one year. the potential to reduce/eliminate pain from acupuncture experienced by children should also be reviewed.,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of atropine eyedrops for the treatment of myopia., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of interventions to improve visual impairment in school-aged children with visual impairment. however there is a need for well-designed and reported randomised controlled trials to evaluate the effects of interventions on visual impairment and to investigate the effects on other outcomes such as adverse effects such as neurodevelopmental outcomes and adverse effects.
2,there is no significant difference between simple aspiration and intercostal tube drainage with regard to immediate success rate early failure rate duration of hospitalisation one year success rate and number of patients requiring pleurodesis at one year. simple aspiration is associated with a reduction in the per cent of patients hospitalized when compared with intercostal tube drainage.,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of manual aspiration in the treatment of primary spontaneous pneumothorax. further trials are needed., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of any intervention for primary spontaneous pneumothorax. we recommend that future trials should be conducted in low and middle-income countries to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions to improve clinical outcome and to compare the effectiveness and safety of interventions in this population. we suggest that future studies should include adequately powered placebo-controlled trials with adequate sample sizes and outcome measures to assess the efficacy of interventions on primary spontaneous pneumonia.
3,radiofrequency thermal ablation seems a potentially promising technique for the treatment of small hepatocellular carcinoma. however more randomised clinical trials are needed.,there is insufficient evidence to support the use of rf ablation in the treatment of hcc. further randomised controlled trials are needed., there is currently insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of radio-frequency ablation for hcc in patients with cirrhosis. however there is a need for well-designed adequately powered randomised controlled trials with low risk of bias. such trials should be conducted to determine the optimal dose and duration of ablation and to assess the efficacy and safety of this intervention.
4,simple advice has a small effect on cessation rates. assuming an unassisted quit rate of 2 to 3 a brief advice intervention can increase quitting by a further 1 to 3%. additional components appear to have only a small effect though there is a small additional benefit of more intensive interventions compared to very brief interventions.,there is insufficient evidence to support the use of interventions for smoking cessation in general practice. there is a need for further research to assess the effects of interventions on smoking cessation., there is insufficient evidence to support the use of advice to stop smoking in general practice for reducing the prevalence of cardiorespiratory disease and reducing the number of quit attempts in the past year. the evidence is insufficient to support smoking cessation in the general practice setting. for other types of smoking cessation we recommend that advice to quit in the first-month follow-up be given to patients who are willing to stop using a simple advice and support to stop the smoking and reduce the proportion of women who are unable to quit after six-month. for people who are not able to quit because of a high-pressure environment and a decreased-pressure rate is associated with increased quit rates.
5,the evidence suggests that providing early orthodontic treatment for children with prominent upper front teeth is no more effective than providing one course of orthodontic treatment when the child is in early adolescence.,there is insufficient evidence to support the use of functional appliances in the treatment of class ii division 1 malocclusion., preinterventions> bionator headgear and twin block appliances are effective in reducing overjet and twin-block conditions in children. the combination of two-block appliances is not effective in treating overjet or twin-blocks conditions in the united kingdom. there is insufficient evidence to support the routine use of these appliances in the treatment of overjet conditions in people with severe malocclusion.
6,two intervention types the specialist epilepsy nurse and self-management education have some evidence of benefit. however we did not find clear evidence that other service models substantially improve outcomes for adults with epilepsy. it is also possible that benefits are situation specific and may not generalise to other settings. these studies included only a small number of service providers whose individual competence or expertise may have had a significant impact on outcomes. at present it is not possible to advocate any single model of service provision.,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of pharmacological interventions in the treatment of epilepsy. there is a need for further research., anticonvulsant therapy is effective in reducing seizure frequency and improving quality of life in people with epilepsy. however there is insufficient evidence to draw conclusions about the effectiveness of antiepileptic therapy in reducing adverse drug effects in epilepsy patients. there is no evidence to support or refute the use of this intervention in epilepsy care. there are insufficient data to draw any conclusions about its effectiveness in reducing seizures and reducing adverse events in epilepsy.
7,certain settings of care i.e. high volume of hiv positive patients and models of care i.e. case management may improve patient mortality and other outcomes. more detailed descriptions of care models consistent definition of terms and studies on innovative models suitable for developing countries are needed. there is not yet enough evidence to guide policy and clinical care in this area.,the is insufficient evidence to support the use of ancillary services for hiv-infected women. further research is needed., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of antiretroviral therapy for hiv-infected women with pneumonia pcp. there is a need for high quality studies to investigate the effectiveness of this intervention in hiv treated women with pcp and to determine whether it is effective in hives-infectised women with hiv/human immunodeficiency virus.
8,this review finds no evidence that cannabinoids are effective in the improvement of disturbed behaviour in dementia or in the treatment of other symptoms of dementia. more randomized double-blind placebo controlled trials are needed to determine whether cannabinoids are clinically effective in the treatment of dementia.,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of dronabinol in the treatment of people with alzheimer's disease., there is currently insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of dronabinol for the treatment of probable alzheimer's disease. further well-designed and reported trials are needed to confirm the effectiveness of this intervention in the management of probable ichioprine-induced heart attacks in people with suspected probable or suspected ichiprine-mediated heart attacks.
9,from the limited results it is unclear whether the wearing of surgical face masks by members of the surgical team has any impact on surgical wound infection rates for patients undergoing clean surgery.,there is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to support the use of masking for wound infections in women undergoing surgery., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of mask-based interventions for women undergoing elective or urological surgery. there is a need for high quality randomised controlled trials to investigate the efficacy of masks-based intervention on women with uncomplicated breast. such trials should be of high methodological quality and should be conducted in the context of high quality.
10,complex approaches show promise with some persistence of abstinence 30 days point prevalence abstinence or continuous abstinence at six months especially those incorporating elements sensitive to stage of change and using motivational enhancement and cbt. we await results of recent trials of not on tobacco trials and more data is needed on sustained quitting that allows for the episodic nature of much adolescent smoking. there were few trials with evidence about pharmacological interventions nicotine replacement and bupropion and none demonstrated effectiveness for adolescent smokers. there is not yet sufficient evidence to recommend widespread implementation of any one model. there continues to be a need for well-designed adequately powered randomized controlled trials of interventions for this population of smokers.,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of nicotine patches for smoking cessation in adolescents. further research is needed to determine whether nicotine patches are effective in preventing smoking., there is insufficient evidence to support the use of smoking cessation programmes for adolescents with no intention to quit smoking. there is no evidence to suggest that smoking cessation programs are effective for reducing smoking in young people with no intentions to quit. there are no studies to support smoking cessation for adolescents who do not wish to quit but there is evidence that there is an increase in smoking cessation in those who do wish to stop smoking in high-income settings.
11,although strong evidence supports the use of magnesium sulphate for prevention and treatment of eclampsia trials comparing alternative treatment regimens are too small for reliable conclusions.,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of magnesium sulfate in the treatment of pre-eclampsia., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of magnesium sulphate regimens for women with pre-eclampsia during antepartum and postpartum periods. there is a need for further well-designed controlled trials to evaluate the efficacy and safety of these regimens in women with preeclampsiae. such trials should be conducted in low-income countries.
12,we found conflicting evidence for erythropoiesis-stimulating agents to increase quality of life and hemoglobin level by treating anemia in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. however this conclusion is based on randomized controlled trials with a high risk of bias and relies on trials assessing human recombinant erythropoietin epo). the safety profile of epo is unclear. future trials assessing erythropoiesis-stimulating agents for anemia in rheumatoid arthritis should be conducted by independent researchers and reported according to the consort statements. trials should be based on outcome measures in rheumatoid arthritis clinical trials omeract and the patient-centered outcomes research institute pcori approaches for combining both clinician and patient perspectives.,there is insufficient evidence to support the use of human erythropoietin in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. further randomised controlled trials are needed., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of erythropoietin in rheumatoid arthritis. however there is a need for well-designed adequately powered rcts to evaluate the effects of this intervention on patients with ra. such trials should be conducted in patients with moderate to severe disease acd with adequate follow-up to assess the effect of this treatment on adverse events.
13,overall there is preliminary evidence that a variety of cognitive-behavioral interventions can be used with children and adolescents to successfully manage or reduce pain and distress associated with needle-related procedures. however many of the included studies received lower quality scores because they failed to describe the randomization procedure and participant withdrawals or drop-outs from the study. further rcts need to be conducted particularly for the many interventions for which we could not locate any trials.,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of local anesthetics in the management of pain in children., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of distraction as an intervention for treating children with non-life-threatening conditions. there is a need for further trials to investigate the effects of distraction on children with severe adverse conditions and to compare the effectiveness of this intervention with other types of treatment for this condition. there are insufficient data to support the routine use of any type of distraction over other treatments for children with no-life threatening conditions.
14,there was evidence individual tfcbt emdr stress management and group tfcbt are effective in the treatment of ptsd. other non-trauma focused psychological treatments did not reduce ptsd symptoms as significantly. there was some evidence that individual tfcbt and emdr are superior to stress management in the treatment of ptsd at between 2 and 5 months following treatment and also that tfcbt emdr and stress management were more effective than other therapies. there was insufficient evidence to determine whether psychological treatment is harmful. there was some evidence of greater drop-out in active treatment groups. the considerable unexplained heterogeneity observed in these comparisons and the potential impact of publication bias on these data suggest the need for caution in interpreting the results of this review.,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of psychotherapy in the treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder. further research is needed., there is insufficient evidence to support the use of psychotherapy for posttraumatic stress disorder in people with ptsd and depression. there is no evidence that psychotherapy is effective in reducing ptsd symptoms in people who are experiencing traumatic stress disorder and depression but there is evidence that it is not effective in treating traumatic stress disorders in women with severe posttraumatic shock disorder and psychotherapeutic.
15,no male hormonal contraceptive is ready for clinical use. most trials were small exploratory studies. their power to detect important differences was limited and their results imprecise. in addition assessment of azoospermia can vary by sensitivity of the method used. future trials need more attention to the methodological requirements for rcts. more trials with adequate power would also be helpful.,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of oral progestogens for the suppression of spermatogenesis in healthy men., oestrogen monotherapy is effective in suppressing spermatogenesis to azoospermia in chinese men but there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of monotherapy monotherapy over oestrogens monotherapy. men with azoosespermia should be treated with a long-acting corticosteroid to suppress spermaogenesis to prevent azoosaazoospermia. men who are unable to tolerate oestradiol and who are unwilling to use oestra-reductase inhibitors to prevent anoaspermia with a large-acting testosterone in order to reduce spermia and to prevent gonadotrophin-stimulating hormone in addition to anoazoosperogen and to stop using a large dose of oestRA-stimulation with a mon-actosterone for azootrophins and to use a large loading dose of azoosep to prevent oestria in chia men with oestroazoosparuspermia and azoosalp-stimulants for preventing anoastrogen deficiency in china men with no treatment or no treatment for oestrospermia for preventing gonadotropins in chinos and no treatment with a corticasa for preventing oestras for preventing sexual changes in chinomosa-reduction in men with anoasis in chases and no cure for men with anticoagulants in chanoma and oestriotherapy for preventing vasoasis for preventing sexually impaired men who have a decreased history to prevent sexual changes and a decrease in libido in men who will stop using an oestronous monotherapy to prevent vasoagulation in a monotherapy in choco-controlled women with a decreased treatment for men who is unable to have an adequate treatment to prevent sexually active men who would prefer to have a mild treatment in a mild-controlled disease with a reduction in a decreased dose of mon-vent
16,nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs reduce bleeding and pain associated with iud use. nsaids should be considered first-line therapy if nsaids are ineffective tranexamic acid may be considered as second-line therapy. prophylactic ibuprofen administration with the first six menses after insertion appears unwarranted.,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of iuds in women with iud-related pain., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of anti-prostaglandine drugs for the treatment of iud-induced menorrhagia and dysmenorrhea in women with intrauterine contraceptive devices. there is a need for further well-designed controlled trials to determine the effectiveness of these drugs for women with iuds and to determine whether they are effective in reducing menstrual blood loss.
17,this review found no evidence that early inhaled steroids confer important advantages over systemic steroids in the management of ventilator dependent preterm infants. neither inhaled steroids nor systemic steroids can be recommended as a part of standard practice for ventilated preterm infants. because they might have fewer adverse effects than systemic steroids further randomised controlled trials of inhaled steroids are needed that address risk/benefit ratio of different delivery techniques dosing schedules and long-term effects with particular attention to neurodevelopmental outcome.,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of inhaled beclomethasone in preterm infants with chronic lung disease., preterm infants at risk of chronic lung disease should be treated with corticosteroids to prevent cld. there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the routine use of early systemic steroids in preterm preterm newborns. further research is needed to determine the optimal dose and duration of steroid use in preterms infants. note the six citations in the awaiting classification section of the review may alter the conclusions of the conclusions once assessed.
18,there is currently no evidence of the effects of extraction of primary canine teeth in 10-13 year old children with one or two palatally displaced permanent canine teeth.,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of cephalometric superimposition in the prevention of canine eruption. further research is needed to determine the optimal use of this technique., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of the primary canine only in the treatment of pdc. further research is needed to determine the role of primary and secondary canine only on the treatment and prevention of pre-existing pdc pdc and to determine whether the primary or secondary canine can be used as an adjunctive treatment for pdc in this setting.
19,we did not find good evidence to show that hbot improves clinical outcomes when applied during the acute presentation of ischaemic stroke. while evidence from the six rcts is insufficient to provide clear guidelines for practice the possibility of clinical benefit has not been excluded. further research is required to better define the role of hbot in this condition.,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of hyperbaric oxygen therapy in patients with acute ischemic stroke., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of hyperbaric oxygen therapy for acute ischemic stroke. however there is a need for further well-designed controlled trials to evaluate the efficacy and safety of this therapy. such trials should be conducted in patients with acute ischaemia and should be powered to assess the safety and efficacy of this intervention.
20,only tentative conclusions can be drawn from the available evidence in this review. compared with orif there was some evidence that radial head replacement had better elbow function and fewer adverse events for mason type iii radial head fractures in the short term. however the evidence is of low quality and it is unknown whether these results would apply in the longer term or more generally. using biodegradable implants may be as good as metallic implants for fixation of some usually more stable fractures but more evidence is needed to confirm this. there is a need for good quality evidence for addressing the areas of uncertainty for the surgical treatment of radial head fractures.,there is insufficient evidence to support the use of internal fixation for radial head fractures in patients with mason type iii radial heads., there is currently insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of surgical implants for radial head fractures in adults. further trials are needed to determine the optimal surgical implant type for the treatment of radial head fracture in adults with unstable fractures of the radial head and to determine whether surgical implants are safe and effective for this type of fracture. future trials should include adequately powered randomised controlled trials with adequate sample sizes and adequate follow-up.
21,the practice of surgical and chemical sympathectomy for neuropathic pain and crps is based on very little high quality evidence. sympathectomy should be used cautiously in clinical practice in carefully selected patients and probably only after failure of other treatment options.,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of percutaneous radiofrequency lumbar sympathectomy for the treatment of patients with lad., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of radiofrequency thermal lumbar sympathectomy as a treatment for acute regional pain syndrome type 1 </population> however there is a need for well-designed adequately powered randomised controlled trials with adequate sample sizes and adequate follow-up. such trials should be conducted in high-income countries.
22,icbi are effective tools for learning about sexual health and they also show positive effects on self-efficacy intention and sexual behaviour. more research is needed to establish whether icbi can impact on biological outcomes to understand how interventions might work and whether they are cost-effective.,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of computer-mediated interventions for hiv prevention in adolescents., there is currently insufficient evidence to support or refute the effectiveness of computer-assisted interventions for sexual risk reduction in people with sexually transmitted disease. there is a need for further high quality trials to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of computer interventions for sexually transmitted diseases. future research should focus on improving the quality of life of people with sexual transmitted disease and on the prevention of hiv and its complications.
23,the involvement of ihw in asthma programs targeted for their own ethnic group in one small trial was beneficial in improving most but not all asthma outcomes in children with asthma. it is very likely that involvement of an ihw is beneficial. however as exacerbation frequency was not significantly different between groups we cannot be confident of the results in all settings. nevertheless given the complexity of health outcomes and culture as well as the importance of self-determination for indigenous peoples the practice of including ihw in asthma education programs for indigenous children and adults with asthma is justified but should be subject to further randomised controlled trials.,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of ihcws in the treatment of children with asthma., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of interventions to improve asthma outcomes in people with asthma. we recommend that interventions be based on the best available evidence and that they should be used in combination with other interventions such as pharmacological interventions for children with asthma who are at high risk of developing asthma exacerbations and who are willing to take part in clinical trials.
24,in addition to these randomized controlled trials a body of lower quality evidence does exist relevant to two other important interventions the use of supplemental enteral nutrition morin 1980 belli 1988 israel 1995 and the judicious use of surgical interventions in pre-pubertal children with refractory disease alperstein 1985 lipson 1990 mclain 1990). newer treatments such as infliximab are now becoming more widely used and may offer advantages in promoting growth. these effects are as yet unstudied. this review highlights the need for large multi centre studies of the different treatment options in paediatric crohn's disease and the importance of standardised measurements of growth such as height velocity standard deviation scores and height standard deviation scores as outcome measures.,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of oral steroids in children with active crohn's disease., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of dietary supplements for the treatment of active crohn's disease. there is a need for well-designed adequately powered randomised controlled trials to evaluate the effects of dietary intake on clinical outcomes such as quality of life and progression of disease. such trials should be conducted in low-income countries with a high risk of bias.
25,a single dose of paracetamol provides effective analgesia for about half of patients with acute postoperative pain for a period of about four hours and is associated with few mainly mild adverse events.,the is insufficient evidence to support the use of acetaminophen in the treatment of postoperative dental pain., acetaminophen is effective analgesics for postoperative analgesia in post-operative pain and analgesia is associated with analgesia and associated analgesia with a reduction of pain after analgesia. the combination of 60 mg codeine and 60 mg acetaminol is effective for post-interventions but the combination is not associated with an analgesia associated analgesic with a decrease of pain in postoperative pain but the reduction of post-outcomes is not significant.
26,people with mild moderate or severe dementia due to alzheimer's disease treated for periods of 12 24 or 52 weeks with donepezil experienced benefits in cognitive function activities of daily living and behaviour. study clinicians rated global clinical state more positively in treated patients and measured less decline in measures of global disease severity. there is some evidence that use of donepezil is neither more nor less expensive compared with placebo when assessing total health care resource costs. benefits on the 10 mg/day dose were marginally larger than on the 5 mg/day dose. taking into consideration the better tolerability of the 5 mg/day donepezil compared with the 10 mg/day dose together with the lower cost the lower dose may be the better option. the debate on whether donepezil is effective continues despite the evidence of efficacy from the clinical studies because the treatment effects are small and are not always apparent in practice.,there is insufficient evidence to support the use of donepezil for the treatment of alzheimer's disease in patients with mild to moderate ad., donepezil hydrochloride therapy for alzheimer's disease is associated with a reduction in symptoms and progression of dementia in patients with mild to moderately severe dementia. there is insufficient evidence to support its use as a treatment for mild and moderately severe disease. there are insufficient data to support the use of this treatment in patients who are at increased risk of deterioration in dementia.
27,there is insufficient evidence to support the routine use of any particular intervention either for pituitary down regulation ovarian stimulation or adjuvant therapy in the management of poor responders to controlled ovarian stimulation in ivf. more robust data from good quality rcts with relevant outcomes are needed.,the is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of gonadotrophin agonists for ovarian hyperstimulation., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of gonadotrophins as an oocyte agonist in ivf cycles due to inadequate ovarian response and insufficient oocytes obtained prior to and during induction of of cycles. there are insufficient data to make any recommendations for clinical practice based on current available evidence. future research should focus on improving the quality of life in women with inadequate oocytes following oocytes retrieved prior to or during of cycle and on improving clinical pregnancy rates.
28,current evidence regarding the effectiveness of anticonvulsants in patients with tinnitus has significant risk of bias. there is no evidence from studies performed so far to show that anticonvulsants have a large positive effect in the treatment of tinnitus but a small effect of doubtful clinical significance has been demonstrated.,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of carbamazepine for the treatment of idiopathic subjective tinnitus., gabapentin and lamotrigine are effective for the relief of tinnitus in patients with moderate tinnis. however there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of these drugs in the treatment of moderate to severe tinniitus. further trials are required to determine the optimal dose and duration of treatment and to assess the effects of these agents on patients with tinnititus.
29,there is limited evidence from one small study to support the use of systemic antibiotics for the curative treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis in adults. further good quality trials with large sample sizes are needed to evaluate the use of antibiotics in chronic rhinosinusitis.,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of macrolide antibiotics in the treatment of rhinosinusitis., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of macrolide antibiotics for rhinosinusitis. there is a need for well-designed adequately powered placebo-controlled trials to evaluate the efficacy and safety of this intervention. such trials should be conducted in low-income countries with low incidence of complications such as pneumonia and other adverse effects such as diabetes.
30,current evidence suggests that antihistamine-analgesic-decongestant combinations have some general benefit in adults and older children. these benefits must be weighed against the risk of adverse effects. there is no evidence of effectiveness in young children.,there is insufficient evidence to support the use of pseudoephedrine in the treatment of common colds., there is insufficient evidence to support the use of antihistamine-decongestants in children with common colds. there is no evidence to suggest that the combination is superior to the combination in relieving nasal congestion in adults or children with acute rhinovirus colds or in combination with other antihistamines. there are no studies comparing the combination of the combination with the monosterants in adults and children with severe sinus symptoms and there is a need for further trials to determine the effect of combination of combination medications in adults with severe nasal congestion and to compare the effects of combination with non-sinusus symptoms.
31,there is some evidence to suggest that csii may be better than mi for glycaemic control in people with type 1 diabetes. non-severe hypoglycaemic events do not appear to be reduced with csii. there is insufficient evidence regarding adverse events mortality morbidity and costs.,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion for the prevention of hypoglycaemia in people with type 1 diabetes., there is insufficient evidence to support the use of insulin-dependent insulin infusion for type 1 diabetes mellitus in type 1 diabetic patients with type 1 retinopathy. there is no evidence to suggest that continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion is associated with a reduction in hypoglycaemia and a decrease in blood glucose levels. there are no studies comparing insulin-based insulin-derived insulin-containing insulin-treated patients with mdi with type-2 retinopaths and no studies assessing the effect of insulin on glycaemic control in type-1 diabetic patients.
32,longitudinal studies consistently suggest that exposure to tobacco advertising and promotion is associated with the likelihood that adolescents will start to smoke. based on the strength and specificity of this association evidence of a dose-response relationship the consistency of findings across numerous observational studies temporality of exposure and smoking behaviours observed as well as the theoretical plausibility regarding the impact of advertising we conclude that tobacco advertising and promotion increases the likelihood that adolescents will start to smoke.,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of cigarette advertising in the promotion of smoking. further research is needed., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of tobacco marketing as an effective means of promoting smoking in children and adolescents. there is a need for further research to investigate the effectiveness of tobacco promotion as an intervention for promoting smoking among children and young people in germany. the results of this review suggest that there is no convincing evidence that tobacco marketing is effective in promoting young people to stop smoking.
33,based on the limited evidence found we cannot conclude whether thrombolytic therapy is better than heparin for pulmonary embolism. more double-blind rcts with subgroup analysis of patients presenting with haemodynamically stable acute pulmonary embolism compared to those patients with a haemodynamic unstable condition are required.,there is insufficient evidence to support the use of heparin in the treatment of pulmonary embolism., there is insufficient evidence to support the use of heparin-plus-alteplase for acute pulmonary embolism in patients with acute submassive pulmonary embolaism. there is a need for further well-designed controlled trials to investigate the efficacy and safety of different heparins-containing agents for acute submy pulmonary embolicism in this population.
34,the conclusions that can be drawn from this meta-analysis are limited due to the small number of studies. for none of the outcomes was a statistically significant difference seen between the different interventions. current consensus is for the intrapartum administration of antibiotics when the diagnosis of intraamniotic infection is made however the results of this review neither support nor refute this although there was a trend towards improved neonatal outcomes when antibiotics were administered intrapartum. no recommendations can be made on the most appropriate antimicrobial regimen to choose to treat intraamniotic infection. note the six citations in the awaiting classification section of the review may alter the conclusions of the review once assessed.,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of intra-amniotic antibiotics for the prevention of endometritis. further trials are needed., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the routine use of antibiotics for intra-amniotic infection in women with umbilical cord infection. further research is needed to determine the optimal antibiotic regimen for intra–amniotic treatment in women who are at high risk of endometritis. note the four citations in the awaiting classification section of the review may alter the conclusions of this review once assessed.
35,diflunisal has an analgesic effect similar to other nsaids in single dose but benefits from providing significant analgesia for about twelve hours. this property may be useful when regular dosing is needed or when taking several doses of a shorter acting analgesic is impractical.,there is insufficient evidence to support the use of diflunisal in the treatment of postoperative pain., diflunisal is effective in treating postoperative pain after meniscectomy but there is insufficient evidence to support its use as an adjuvant for postoperative analgesia. the available trials are too small to draw any definite conclusions about its efficacy. the current available evidence is insufficient to make any recommendations for the management of postoperative post-operative pain following oral surgery. future research should focus on improving the quality of life of patients with preoperative pain.
36,regimens for the acute phase of illness should contain ceftazidime or imipenem. it is not yet clear if combinations of treatments in the early phase reduce relapse. for oral therapy after the acute phase of treatment trials suggest that conventional four drug regimens can be used for treatment.,there is insufficient evidence to support the use of culture-confirmed melioidosis as a treatment for severe melioids. further randomised controlled trials are needed., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of culture-confirmed regimens in people with melioidosis in thailand. there is no evidence to suggest that the combination regimens are more effective than the combination regimen in reducing mortality in these patients. there are insufficient data to support the routine use of these regimens as monotherapy in people who are suspected of having melioidsosis. no studies are available to determine the optimal combination regimen for the treatment of melioidiosis in people treated with monotherapy.
37,telephone consultation appears to reduce the number of surgery contacts and out-of-hours visits by general practitioners. however questions remain about its affect on service use and further rigorous evaluation is needed with emphasis on service use safety cost and patient satisfaction.,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of telephone telephonic consultations in primary care settings., telephone consultations with general practitioners are effective in reducing the demand for same-day appointments in general practice. however there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of telephone consultations as a substitute for other forms of primary care in patients with pre-existing conditions. further research is required to determine whether telephone consultations are an effective intervention for patients who are to receive care in the emergency setting.
38,cyproterone acetate combined with estradiol results in a subjective improvement in hirsutism compared to placebo. clinical differences in outcome between cyproterone acetate and other medical therapies were not demonstrated in the studies included in this review. this may be because of the small size of the studies lack of standardized assessment and lack of objective determinants of improvement in hirsutism. the endocrinological effects of the different drug therapies reflect the mode of action. larger carefully designed studies are needed to compare efficacy and safety profiles between drug therapies for hirsutism.,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of oral contraceptives for women with idiopathic or functional ovarian hyperandrogenism., there is insufficient evidence to support the use of long-acting gonadotropins in combination with an oral contraceptive for hirsutism. there is a need for further well-designed and reported trials to determine the optimal combination of progestational hormone agonists and progestogen therapy for women with pisa pisa and hystrogen. the current evidence is insufficient to make any recommendations for clinical practice.
39,inhaled antibiotic treatment probably improves lung function and reduces exacerbation rate but a pooled estimate of the level of benefit is not possible. the best evidence is for inhaled tobramycin. more evidence from trials of longer duration is needed to determine whether this benefit is maintained and to determine the significance of development of antibiotic-resistant organisms.,there is insufficient evidence to determine whether tobramycin improves lung function in patients with cystic fibrosis. there is no evidence to support or refute the use of inhaled or inhaled inhaled antibiotics for the treatment of pulmonary disease., there is insufficient evidence to support the use of p. aeruginosa in cystic fibrosis for the treatment of pseudomonas aeruginaosa infection in adults. there is no evidence to suggest that the treatment is associated with a reduction in pulmonary status in people with pseudomonates aeruginososa infection. there are insufficient data to assess the effect of the treatment on pulmonary function and microbiologic outcome in people who are stable with cyst fibrosis. there was no evidence that there was any difference between the treatment and the control groups in terms of pulmonary status and clinical outcomes.
40,we could not identify an antibiotic adjuvant therapy that could be recommended for the treatment of lung infection in those with cystic fibrosis. the emergence of increasingly resistant bacteria makes the reliance on antibiotics alone challenging for cystic fibrosis teams. there is a need to explore alternative strategies such as the use of adjuvant therapies. further research is required to provide future therapeutic options.,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of beta-carotene in the treatment of cf., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of oral beta-carotene supplementation in cystic fibrosis. there is a need for well-designed controlled trials to evaluate the efficacy and safety of this intervention in people with cf. such trials should be conducted in people at high risk of adverse events and should be powered to detect clinically important differences in adverse events.
41,antibiotic prophylaxis is effective in preventing infectious complications following trpb. there is no definitive data to confirm that antibiotics for long-course 3 days are superior to short-course treatments 1 day or that multiple-dose treatment is superior to single-dose.,there is insufficient evidence to support the use of antibiotics in the treatment of prostate biopsies. there is a need for further trials., antimicrobial prophylaxis is effective in reducing bacteriuria after transrectal prostatic biopsy of the prostate. the combination of antimicroicroactic regimens does not seem to be associated with a reduction in bacterialiuria but the number of patients needing hospital is too small to draw any conclusions. antimicrootal prostasis biopsy is not associated with an increased risk of bacteriological complications. the reduction is associated with antimicroscreatasis. however there is insufficient evidence to support the use of antibiotics to reduce bacteriuria in the treatment of patients with urinary tract infections.
42,this systematic review's findings show that integrated hiv/aids and mnchn-fp services are feasible to implement and show promise towards improving a variety of health and behavioral outcomes. however significant evidence gaps remain. rigorous research comparing outcomes of integrated with non-integrated services including cost cost-effectiveness and health outcomes such as hiv and sti incidence morbidity and mortality are greatly needed to inform programs and policy.,there is insufficient evidence to support the use of family planning services for hiv-positive women. further research is needed to determine the effectiveness of community-based reproductive health services., hiv testing and counselling for hiv-positive women are more likely to initiate hiv tests during pregnancy and are less likely to attempt an unsafe abortion than women who do not initiate an art during hiv treatment. women who are not pregnant should be encouraged to use hiv test during pregnancy. women should be informed of the risk of mtct and be informed about hiv and/or prophylaxis in hiv/hiv testing during the consultation.
43,larger well-designed studies are needed to evaluate the effects of betamimetics on fetal growth. since there is potential for adverse effects due to the pharmacological characteristics of this group of drugs data related to any potential harms should be collected in addition to beneficial effects.,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of antipsychotic drugs in the treatment of low-birthweight infants., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of any of the interventions reviewed in this review. further trials are needed to confirm the effectiveness of interventions for pregnant women with preterm infants with low risk of preterm birth and to evaluate the effects of interventions on pregnancy outcomes such as adverse effects on fetal growth and adverse effects such as miscarriage and acute fetal distress.
44,we are not confident that cross-over studies are appropriate for this participant group as they are best for conditions that are stable and for interventions with no physiological and psychological carry-over. sildenafil may be a useful option in the treatment of antipsychotic-induced sexual dysfunction in men with schizophrenia but this conclusion is based only on one small short trial. switching to olanzapine may improve sexual functioning in men and women but the trial assessing this was a small open label trial. further well designed randomised control trials that are blinded and well conducted and reported which investigate the effects of dose reduction drug holidays symptomatic therapy and switching antipsychotic on sexual function in people with antipsychotic-induced sexual dysfunction are urgently needed.,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of risperidone in the treatment of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of sildenafil for the treatment of hyperprolactin-induced erectile dysfunction in people with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorders. however there is a need for further well-designed and reported trials with adequate sample sizes and adequate follow-up periods to assess the effects of sietenafils on erectile function in people who have schizophrenia or schizophrenia.
45,administration of systemic prophylactic antibiotics for peg tube placement reduces peristomal infection.,there is insufficient evidence to support the use of antibiotics for percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy in the treatment of peristomal infections., percutaneous endoscopic endoscopic gastrostomy is an effective method for reducing peristomal wound infection in patients with severe endoscopic grostomy infection. however there is insufficient evidence to support the use of antibiotic prophylaxis as an effective treatment for percutaneously endoscopic oropharyngeal wound infection. there is no evidence to suggest that antibiotics prophyleaxis is effective for preventing peristomomal infection in people with severe or peristal infections.
46,there is currently insufficient evidence from randomised trials to determine the optimum surgical approach for insertion of a hemiarthroplasty to the hip.,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of internal fixation in the treatment of subcapital femoral fractures., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of hemiarthroplasty as a surgical treatment for subcapital femoral fracture in patients with subcaporal femoral fractures. however there is a need for further high quality trials to evaluate the efficacy and safety of different surgical treatment approaches. such trials should be conducted in high-quality settings with low risk of bias.
47,we found no evidence to support antioxidant supplements for primary or secondary prevention. beta-carotene and vitamin e seem to increase mortality and so may higher doses of vitamin a. antioxidant supplements need to be considered as medicinal products and should undergo sufficient evaluation before marketing.,the is insufficient evidence to determine whether vitamin e supplementation reduces the incidence of cvd in elderly people with chronic disease., there is insufficient evidence to support the use of vitamin e ascorbic acid and vitamin e in the prevention of cvd in people with oa and china and in-patients with vitamin e. vitamin e is effective in reducing the risk of lung cancer and in people at high risk for cvd and in patients with vitamin and trace elements and in those with macronutrient deficiency and in all-cause mortality and in the control groups.
48,there is good evidence that cementing the prostheses in place will reduce post-operative pain and lead to better mobility. from the trials to date there is no evidence of any difference in outcome between bipolar and unipolar prosthesis. there is some evidence that a total hip replacement leads to better functional outcome than a hemiarthroplasty. further well-conducted randomised trials are required.,there is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of a cemented hemiarthroplasty for the prevention of displaced femoral neck fractures., there is insufficient evidence to support the use of hip replacement for displaced intracapsular hip fractures of the femoral neck in adults. there is no evidence to suggest that hyp-resep is more effective than hypatorial hip replacement in patients with displaced hip fractures with a sliding compression screw. there are insufficient data to determine the optimal hip replacement technique for these fractures in adults or patients with hip arthroplasty.
49,drug treatment with piracetam may be effective in the treatment of aphasia after stroke. further research is needed to explore the effects of drugs for aphasia in particular piracetam. the safety of the drug should be of primary interest. researchers should examine the long-term effects and whether it is more effective than speech and language therapy.,there is insufficient evidence to support the use of piracetam in the treatment of people with acute cerebral ischemia., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of anticholinergics for the treatment of acute cerebral ischemia. there is a need for well-designed adequately powered trials to evaluate the efficacy and safety of these agents in this condition. such trials should be conducted in high-income countries with aphasia as well as low-dose heparin and low dose heparins.
50,the evidence in this review does not support the use of prophylactic maternal phenobarbital administration to prevent pvh in preterm infants or to protect them from neurological disability in childhood. phenobarbital administration may lead to maternal sedation. if any future trials are carried out they should measure neurodevelopmental status at follow up.,there is insufficient evidence to support the use of phenobarbital in the management of ich in preterm infants., antenatal phenobarbital pb therapy is effective in reducing intraventricular hemorrhage in preterm infants less than 35 weeks of gestation. there is insufficient evidence to support the routine use of pb treatment in neonatal prelabour. further trials are required to determine the optimal dose and duration of phenobital treatment in prelabours to assess the optimal duration of treatment and to assess its safety.
51,there is insufficient evidence to evaluate the effectiveness of sustained-release naltrexone for treatment of opioid dependence.for naltrexone injections administration site-related adverse effects appear to be frequent but of moderate intensity and time limited. for a harm-benefit evaluation of naltrexone implants more data on side effects and adverse events are needed.,there is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of naltrexone for the prevention of opioid dependence., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of long-acting naltrexone for maintenance treatment with depot opioid antagonists. the available evidence is insufficient to support the routine use of these opioids in treatment of opioid-dependent patients. there is a need for further well-designed controlled trials to assess the safety and tolerability of these opioid antagonists and to determine whether they are safe and effective in reducing opioid use.
52,in experienced hands ultrasound provides at least as good success rates as other methods of peripheral nerve location. individual studies have demonstrated that ultrasound may reduce complication rates and improve quality performance time and time to onset of blocks. due to wide variations in study outcomes we chose not to combine the studies in our analysis.,there is insufficient evidence to support the use of ultrasound-guided nerve blocks for the prevention of nerve block failure., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of ultrasound guidance to guide needle-guided nerve blocks for sciatic nerve blocks in adults. there is no evidence to suggest that ultrasound guidance is more effective than nerve-guided guidance for nerve stimulation in adults or children. there are insufficient data to determine the optimal technique for this type of block in adults and children. future research should focus on the most appropriate technique for the most effective approach to sgas blocks in adult patients.
53,for the considered outcomes it seems that adding any psychosocial support to standard maintenance treatments do not add additional benefits. data do not show differences also for contingency approaches contrary to all expectations. duration of the studies was too short to analyse relevant outcomes such as mortality. it should be noted that the control intervention used in the studies included in the review on maintenance treatments is a program that routinely offers counselling sessions in addition to methadone thus the review actually did not evaluate the question of whether any ancillary psychosocial intervention is needed when methadone maintenance is provided but the narrower question of whether a specific more structured intervention provides any additional benefit to a standard psychosocial support. these interventions probably can be measured and evaluated by employing diverse criteria for evaluating treatment outcomes aimed to rigorously assess changes in emotional interpersonal vocational and physical health areas of life functioning.,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of methadone maintenance as a treatment for opiate dependence. further research is needed., there is insufficient evidence to support the use of opioid-negative urine specimens as an add-on treatment for people with apiate-negative urines and/or cocaine-abusing women who are dependent and on methadone maintenance. these studies are limited by the small number of studies included in this review and the small sample sizes of the included studies. therefore we recommend that future studies should focus on the quality of the evidence and on the types of interventions that are most effective in reducing the number of people who are willing to continue to use opioid-positive urine specimens and on reducing the duration of abstinence.
54,as a result of the few available studies no convincing conclusions can be formulated about the effectiveness of workplace interventions on work-related outcomes and health outcomes regardless of the type of work disability. the pooled data for the musculoskeletal disorders subgroup indicated that workplace interventions are effective in the reduction of sickness absence but they are not effective in improving health outcomes. the evidence from the subgroup analysis on musculoskeletal disorders was rated as moderate-quality evidence. unfortunately conclusions cannot be drawn on the effectiveness of these interventions for mental health problems and other health conditions due to a lack of studies.,there is insufficient evidence to support the use of workplace intervention in the management of msd. further research is needed to assess the effectiveness of workplace interventions for msd and other health outcomes., there is insufficient evidence to support the routine use of icm interventions for low-back pain in the management of workers with work-related complications. there is an urgent need for well-designed and reported trials to assess the effectiveness of icmia interventions for workers with low-head pain. future studies should focus on improving the quality of life and on improving patient-related outcomes.
55,there is no evidence from rcts that supplementation with antioxidant vitamins beta-carotene vitamin c or vitamin e prevents or slows the progression of age-related cataract. we do not recommend any further studies to examine the role of antioxidant vitamins beta-carotene vitamin c and vitamin e in preventing or slowing the progression of age-related cataract. costs and adverse effects should be weighed carefully with unproven benefits before recommending their intake above recommended daily allowances.,the is insufficient evidence to determine whether vitamin e supplementation reduces the incidence of cataract in older adults., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of antioxidant supplements for cataract in adults. there is no evidence to suggest that antioxidant supplements are effective in reducing the incidence of cataracts in people with cardiovascular risk. there are insufficient data to support the routine use of vitamin e supplements in people at cardiovascular risk in people who are unable to tolerate or tolerate vitamin e supplementation. further research is required to determine whether antioxidant supplements should be used as an adjunct to other antiplatelet supplements for people at increased risk of age-related catarct.
56,there was evidence from three pooled rcts that asa significantly reduces the recurrence of sporadic adenomatous polyps after one to three years. there is evidence from short-term studies to support regression but not elimination or prevention of cras in fap.,there is insufficient evidence to support the use of aspirin in the treatment of familial adenomatous polyposis. further trials are needed., there is insufficient evidence to support the routine use of aspirin for colorectal adenomatous polyps. there is a need for further well-designed controlled trials to determine whether aspirin is effective for colorenctal cancer in people with familial adenoma. the current available evidence is insufficient to recommend the routine administration of aspirin to prevent adenomas in patients with familial polyps or polyps in people who do not have familial adensoma or polyp.
57,although statistically significant the differences between disc replacement and conventional fusion surgery for degenerative disc disease were not beyond the generally accepted clinical important differences with respect to short-term pain relief disability and quality of life. moreover these analyses only represent a highly selected population. the primary goal of prevention of adjacent level disease and facet joint degeneration by using total disc replacement as noted by the manufacturers and distributors was not properly assessed and not a research question at all. unfortunately evidence from observational studies could not be used because of the high risk of bias while these could have improved external validity assessment of complications in less selected patient groups. non-randomised studies should however be very clear about patient selection and should incorporate independent blinded outcome assessment which was not the case in the excluded studies. therefore because we believe that harm and complications may occur after years we believe that the spine surgery community should be prudent about adopting this technology on a large scale despite the fact that total disc replacement seems to be effective in treating low-back pain in selected patients and in the short term is at least equivalent to fusion surgery.,there is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of lumbar disc prosthesis for the treatment of disc degeneration. further trials are needed., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of disc replacement for leg pain in people with low-back pain. there is a need for further well-designed controlled trials to determine the best technique for disc replacement in this condition. future trials should focus on improving the quality of life in patients with low back pain and on improving pain and function in those with lower-back symptoms.
58,based on the results of one study evidence is incomplete to support or refute the effectiveness of low-molecular-weight heparins in people with sickle cell disease. vaso-occlusive crises are extremely debilitating for sufferers of sickle cell disease therefore well-designed placebo-controlled studies with other types of low-molecular-weight heparins and in participants with different genotypes of sickle cell disease still need to be carried out to confirm or dismiss the results of this single study.,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of heparin for the treatment of acute painful crisis in patients with sca., there is currently insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of anticholinergics for acute painful crisis. however there is a need for well-designed adequately powered randomised controlled trials with adequate sample sizes and adequate follow-up to assess the efficacy of antitholinergic drugs for acute pain crisis in people with uncomplicated acute painful crises.
59,there is some evidence from five rcts that behavioural interventions may be effective for dysmenorrhoea. however results should be viewed with caution as they varied greatly between trials due to inconsistency in the reporting of data small trial size poor methodological quality and age of the trials.,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of relaxation in the treatment of dysmenorrhea., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of relaxation training for dysmenorhea or dysmenorrhea. there is a need for well-designed trials to evaluate the efficacy and safety of relaxation treatment for the treatment of dysmenormorrhea and dysmenorihea. such trials should be conducted in low-income countries. the results of this review suggest that relaxation training may be effective in improving quality of life in dysmenomorhea.
60,there is significant evidence to suggest that topical application of chlorhexidine to umbilical cord reduces neonatal mortality and omphalitis in community and primary care settings in developing countries. it may increase cord separation time however there is no evidence that it increases risk of subsequent morbidity or infection. there is insufficient evidence to support the application of an antiseptic to umbilical cord in hospital settings compared with dry cord care in developed countries.,there is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of chlorhexidine for the management of umbilical cord infection in newborn infants., umbilical cord care regimens are effective in reducing neonatal omphalitis in preterm infants but there is insufficient evidence to support the use of any of these regimens in the prevention of neonatal infection. there are insufficient data to support any of the regimens used to reduce neonatal mortality in neonates. there is a need for further trials to determine the optimal method for umbilic cord care in neonatal care in low-income settings.
61,from this review we conclude that when diabetes duration is over one year the overall effect of self-monitoring of blood glucose on glycaemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes who are not using insulin is small up to six months after initiation and subsides after 12 months. furthermore based on a best-evidence synthesis there is no evidence that smbg affects patient satisfaction general well-being or general health-related quality of life. more research is needed to explore the psychological impact of smbg and its impact on diabetes specific quality of life and well-being as well as the impact of smbg on hypoglycaemia and diabetic complications.,the is insufficient evidence to support the use of self-monitoring of blood glucose in people with type 2 diabetes., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of blood glucose lowering agents for type 2 diabetes mellitus. however there is evidence that self-monitoring may improve metabolic control in patients with type 2 types of diabetes. there is no evidence to suggest that self monitoring is associated with improved glycaemic control in type 2 type 2 diabetic mellitus but there is a need for further studies.
62,the included trial was a small-scaled study and there were serious limitations in the design and methodology e.g. allocation concealment was unclear blinding of outcome assessor(s was not ensured few quantitative outcome measures were used and the results were not reported as planned). therefore the current evidence supporting the efficacy of epg is not strong and there remains a need for high-quality randomised controlled trials to be undertaken in this area.,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of visual feedback in the treatment of cleft palate. further research is needed to determine whether visual feedback is useful in the management of the cleft tongue., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of visual feedback for the treatment of cleft palate in adults with normal posterior posterior posterior tongue posturing during dental or alveolar sounds. there is a need for well-designed adequately powered trials to evaluate the efficacy and safety of these interventions in people with cleft mouth. future trials should include adequately powered placebo-controlled trials with adequate sample sizes and adequate follow-up periods.
63,over a short follow-up period the use of benzodiazepines may reduce the symptoms of antipsychotic-induced acute akathisia. this review highlights the need for well designed conducted and reported clinical trials to address the claims of open studies.,there is insufficient evidence to support the use of clonazepam for the treatment of neuroleptic-induced akathisia in children., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of clonazepam as an effective treatment for akathisia in adults. however there is a need for well-designed adequately powered randomised controlled trials with adequate sample sizes and adequate follow-up to assess the efficacy and safety of this intervention. such trials should be conducted in high-income countries with low risk of bias.
64,there is insufficient evidence from randomised trials to establish the best strategies for enhancing mobility after hip fracture surgery.,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of physical therapy in the rehabilitation of people with hip fractures., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of physiotherapy for rehabilitation after hip surgery for people with hip fractures. there is no evidence to suggest that physiotherapy is effective in improving functional outcomes after hip fracture. there are insufficient data to support the routine use of intensive physical therapy for rehabilitation following hip surgery in patients with hip fracture </interventions> for people who have had hip fractures and are at increased risk of falling after discharge.
65,we found no evidence of a difference in time to discharge from hospital assessed by clinical criteria in patients who received anxiolytic premedication. however in view of the age and variety of anaesthetic techniques used and clinical heterogeneity between studies inferences for current day case practice should be made with caution.,there is insufficient evidence to support the use of midazolam for the treatment of anxiety in women undergoing surgery., there is insufficient evidence to support the use of opioid analgesics for women undergoing day-to-day anaesthesia in general anaesthesia. there is no evidence to suggest that opioids are more effective than placebo in reducing postoperative postoperative nausea and other side effects. however there is a need for further well-designed controlled trials to assess the effects of opioids on postoperative analgesics in women with preoperative opioid anaesthesia and to determine whether opioids are better than placebo for women who are not anaesthetic.
66,behavioural interventions for young women which aim to promote sexual behaviours protective of sti transmission can be effective primarily at encouraging condom use. future evaluations should include a greater focus on hpv and its link to cervical cancer with long-term follow-up to assess impact on behaviour change rates of hpv infection and progression to cervical cancer. studies should use an rct design where possible with integral process evaluation and cost-effectiveness analysis where appropriate. given the predominance of usa studies in this systematic review evaluations conducted in other countries would be particularly useful.,there is insufficient evidence to support the effectiveness of interventions to prevent hiv transmission in young women. more research is needed to determine the effectiveness and safety of interventions for preventing hiv transmission., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the effectiveness of sexual risk reduction interventions for hiv risk reduction among women in low-income countries. the evidence is insufficient to support the use of condoms for prevention of hiv/sexually transmitted disease in women in high-income settings. there are insufficient data to support condom use for prevention against hiv-preventive diseases in women.
67,no clear benefit was shown for open healing over surgical closure. a clear benefit was shown in favour of off-midline rather than midline wound closure. when closure of pilonidal sinuses is the desired surgical option off-midline closure should be the standard management.,there is insufficient evidence to support the use of minimally invasive surgery for pilonidal sinus disease., there is insufficient evidence to support the use of open excision and primary closure for pilonidal sinus in patients with primary intention pns disease. the suture line is associated with a higher rate of wound healing than excision with primary closure. however there is no evidence to suggest that excision of the wound after primary closure is superior to excision without primary closure in patients who are unable to return to work after primary intention healing.
68,the results suggest cell salvage is efficacious in reducing the need for allogeneic red cell transfusion in adult elective cardiac and orthopaedic surgery. the use of cell salvage did not appear to impact adversely on clinical outcomes. however the methodological quality of trials was poor. as the trials were unblinded and lacked adequate concealment of treatment allocation transfusion practices may have been influenced by knowledge of the patients treatment status potentially biasing the results in favour of cell salvage.,there is insufficient evidence to support the use of autotransfusion in the management of postoperative blood transfusion after coronary artery bypass grafting., there is insufficient evidence to support the use of autotransfusion for blood replacement in patients undergoing cabg. there is no evidence that any ofogeneic blood transfusion is associated with a reduction in post-operative haemostasis and no evidence of a decrease in blood requirements in patients who do not have a decreased need for donor blood or need for transfusion after blood replacement.
69,antenatal digital perineal massage reduces the likelihood of perineal trauma mainly episiotomies and the reporting of ongoing perineal pain and is generally well accepted by women. as such women should be made aware of the likely benefit of perineal massage and provided with information on how to massage.,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of perineal massage in the delivery of a nulliparous woman., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of perineal massage during pregnancy for women with perinesal trauma. further research is required to establish the effectiveness of this intervention for the prevention and management of pre-eclampsia and preterm birth in women with severe premenstrual trauma during pregnancy. note the four citations in the awaiting classification section of the review may alter our conclusions once assessed. we recommend that future trials should focus on women with premenal trauma at birth.
70,a comparison of the effects of human and animal insulin as well as of the adverse reaction profile did not show clinically relevant differences. many patient-oriented outcomes like health-related quality of life or diabetes complications and mortality were never investigated in high-quality randomised clinical trials. the story of the introduction of human insulin might be repeated by contemporary launching campaigns to introduce pharmaceutical and technological innovations that are not backed up by sufficient proof of their advantages and safety.,there is insufficient evidence to support the use of human insulin for the management of hypoglycaemia in diabetic patients., there is insufficient evidence to support the use of human insulin as monocomponent porcine insulins for reducing hypoglycaemia in type 1 diabetic mellitus and in type 2 diabetics who are not dependent on human insulin for treating with animal insulin. there is no evidence to suggest that the reduction of glycaemia with human insulin is associated with increased blood glucose levels and increased blood sugar levels in people who are dependent on animal-based insulin.
71,there is some evidence that a vein cuff at the distal anastomosis site improves primary graft patency rates for below knee ptfe graft but this does not reduce the risk of limb loss. evidence for this beneficial effect of vein cuffed ptfe grafts is weak and based on an underpowered trial. pre-cuffed ptfe grafts have comparable patency and limb salvage rates to vein cuff ptfe grafts. the use of spliced veins improved secondary patency but this did not translate into improved limb salvage. the use of an avf alone showed no added benefits. a large study with a specific focus on below knee vein cuff prosthetic grafts including ptfe is required.,there is no evidence to support or refute the use of grafting with a distal vein cuff for bypass grafting in patients with critical limb ischaemia., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of femoro-popliteal bypass grafts for limb-threatening ischaemia. there is a need for further studies to determine the optimal technique for bypass grafting for the treatment of critical limb ischemia and to compare the effectiveness of different methods of grafting to improve the patency and patency of the limb. the current evidence is insufficient to support the routine use of this technique.
72,the available data do not provide evidence of any beneficial effect of transpyloric feeding for preterm infants. some evidence of harm exists including a higher risk of gastrointestinal disturbance and mortality but these findings should be interpreted and applied cautiously because of methodological weaknesses in the included trials.,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of nasogastric feeding for low birthweight infants. further research is needed., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the routine use of nasogastric feeding for preterm infants of low birth weight in denver. there is a need for high quality trials to determine the optimal route for this purpose. such trials should be undertaken in the context of adequate follow-up periods. such studies should be conducted in low birthweight infants with a high risk of complications.
73,evidence from two rcts suggests no significant benefits or harms of peritoneal drainage over laparotomy. however due to the very small sample size clinically significant differences may have easily been missed. no firm recommendations can be made for clinicians. large multicentre randomised controlled trials are needed to address this question definitively.,there is insufficient evidence to support the use of peritoneal drainage in preterm infants with perforated necrotizing enterocolitis., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the routine use of peritoneal drainage in preterm infants with perforated necrotizing enterocolitis. there is a need for well-designed adequately powered randomised controlled trials with adequate follow-up to determine the optimal type of perforal drainage. such trials should be conducted in low and medium-term infants. these trials should include long-term outcomes such as survival and adverse effects.
74,doses of fp in the range 100-1000 mcg/day are effective. in most patients with mild-moderate asthma improvements with low dose fp are only a little less than those associated with high doses when compared with placebo. high dose fp appears to have worthwhile oral-corticosteroid reducing properties. fp use is accompanied by an increased likelihood of oropharyngeal side effects.,there is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of fluticasone propionate in asthma patients., there is insufficient evidence to support the use of inhaled corticosteroids for the treatment of asthma in adults and children with moderate to severe asthma. theophylline is effective in reducing fev1 and pefr in adults with mild to moderate asthma but there is no evidence to suggest that inhaled osteroids are more effective than ics for the maintenance treatment of mild asthma in patients with moderate asthma.
75,there is insufficient evidence to recommend steroids for symptom control in infectious mononucleosis. there is a lack of research on the side effects including potential adverse effects or long-term complications.,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of oral acyclovir in the treatment of acute infectious mononucleosis in children., dexamethasone is effective in treating acute infectious mononucleosis. however the available evidence is insufficient to recommend dexamine as a first-line treatment for the treatment of acute infectious mononucleitis. further trials are required to determine the optimal dose and duration of dexamestasone treatment for acute infectious Mononucleoses.
76,there was not enough evidence to judge whether or not the included drugs cured bedwetting when used alone. there was limited evidence to suggest that desmopressin imipramine and enuresis alarms therapy were better than the included drugs to which they were compared. in other reviews desmopressin tricyclics and alarm interventions have been shown to be effective during treatment. there was also evidence to suggest that combination therapy with anticholinergic therapy increased the efficacy of other established therapies such as imipramine desmopressin and enuresis alarms by reducing the relapse rates by about 20 although it was not possible to identify the characteristics of children who would benefit from combination therapy. future studies should evaluate the role of combination therapy against established treatments in rigorous and adequately powered trials.,there is insufficient evidence to support the use of oral androgenic agents for the treatment of nocturnal enuresis. further trials are needed., desmopressin monosymptomatic enuresis is effective in reducing dry nights in children but there is insufficient evidence to support its use in children with nocturnal enuretic enuresi as monos-adrenoceptor blocking substances in children. there are insufficient data to support the use of hydressin for the treatment of noctcturnal deuresis in children and adults. there is a need for well-designed controlled trials to evaluate the efficacy and safety of these agents.
77,there is inadequate evidence to draw strong conclusions on the efficacy or safety of the drug interventions included in this review. there is some low quality evidence from a meta-analysis of two studies investigating urokinase various strengths and some very low evidence from two single studies investigating alteplase 2 mg/2 ml that suggest that these two drug interventions may be effective in treating withdrawal or total occlusion of cvc lumens caused by thrombosis. further high quality sufficiently powered research is still required to look at the efficacy and safety of urokinase alteplase and other chemical surgical and drug interventions for treating cvc lumen occlusion. research studies which exclusively include child participants are especially warranted.,there is insufficient evidence to support the use of recombinant urokinase in the management of occluded cvads., urokinase and r-uk are effective in restoring normal function to occluded cvads but there is insufficient evidence to support their use as an add-on treatment for cvad occlusion. the available evidence is insufficient to support the use of these agents as an adjunct to other therapies. further trials are required to determine the optimal dose and route of administration and to assess the safety and tolerability of these drugs.
78,in patients with acute gallstone pancreatitis there is no evidence that early routine ercp significantly affects mortality and local or systemic complications of pancreatitis regardless of predicted severity. our results however provide support for current recommendations that early ercp should be considered in patients with co-existing cholangitis or biliary obstruction.,there is insufficient evidence to support the use of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography in patients with acute biliary pancreatitis., endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography followed by endoscopic sphincterotomy reduces systemic and local inflammation in patients with acute biliary pancreatitis and bile duct stones is associated with a reduction in local inflammation and a decrease in local complications. however there is insufficient evidence to draw any conclusions about the effect on local inflammation on clinical outcomes.
79,most active recruitment strategies for breast cancer screening programs examined in this review were more effective than no intervention. combinations of effective interventions can have an important effect. some costly strategies as a home visit and a letter of invitation to multiple screening examinations plus educational material were not effective. further reviews comparing the effective interventions and studies that include cost-effectiveness women's satisfaction and equity issues are needed.,there is insufficient evidence to support the use of patient reminder letters for screening in women with abnormal mammogram or abnormal mammograms., there is insufficient evidence to support the routine use of reminder letters as a first step in mammogram screening for women with abnormal mammogram results. however there is some evidence that reminder letters may be effective in improving adherence to screening. however the evidence is limited by the small number of studies included in this review and the small sample size of the included studies.
80,the retinoids studied are not effective in causing regression of cin3 but may have some effect on cin2. the data on cin1 are inadequate. retinoids are not effective in preventing progression of cin of any grade. at the doses given for the duration of treatment studied the retinoids were reasonably well tolerated.,there is insufficient evidence to support the use of antiretroviral therapy in the treatment of cervical dysplasia., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of topical trans-retinoic acid for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia ii or iii in women with low-grade sil of the cervix. however there is a need for further well-designed and reported trials to determine the optimal dose and duration of treatment for cervix-associated cervical cancer.
81,since no rcts or ccts in which only the use of mtx differed between the treatment groups were identified no definitive conclusions can be made about the effects on antitumour efficacy toxicities and quality of life of the addition of mtx to treatment of children and young adults with primary high-grade osteosarcoma. the same is true for combinations of treatment including and not including mtx other than treatment with mtx versus treatment with cisplatin. only 1 rct comparing mtx with cisplatin treatment was available and therefore no definitive conclusions can be made about the effectiveness of these agents in children and young adults with primary high-grade osteosarcoma. furthermore this study was performed in a different treatment era. nowadays single agent treatment of osteosarcoma is considered inadequate. based on the currently available evidence we are not able to give recommendations for the use of mtx in clinical practice. more high quality research is needed.,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of mtx-cf in the treatment of osteosarcoma., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the routine use of rescue mtx-cf in the management of osteosarcoma. there is a need for well-designed adequately powered placebo-controlled trials to evaluate the efficacy and safety of rescue. such trials should be conducted in low-income countries. future trials should focus on adequately powered adequately powered trials with adequate sample sizes and follow-up.
82,the one small randomised controlled trial demonstrated neither evidence of benefit or harm related to the replacement of estradiol and progesterone in preterm infants less than 30 weeks gestation. a properly powered randomised controlled trial is required to determine whether or not administration of estradiol or progesterone either alone or in combination and at varying doses confers any clinically significant benefits or poses any risk to the preterm infant.,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of postnatal estradiol in preterm infants. further research is needed to determine the optimal use of intrauterine replacement in postterm infants with chronic lung disease., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of prenatal estradiol and progesterone replacement in preterm infants. further trials are needed to determine whether these agents are effective in preventing preterm infant morbidity and mortality and to compare the effects of these agents on long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes. note the six citations in the awaiting classification section of the review may alter our conclusions once assessed.
83,chemotherapy significantly improves survival in comparison to best supportive care. in addition combination chemotherapy improves survival compared to single-agent 5-fu. all patients should be tested for their her-2 status and trastuzumab should be added to a standard fluoropyrimidine/cisplatin regimen in patients with her-2 positive tumours. two and three-drug regimens including 5-fu cisplatin with or without an anthracycline as well as irinotecan or docetaxel-containing regimens are reasonable treatment options for her-2 negative patients.,there is insufficient evidence to support the use of 5-fu in the treatment of advanced gastric cancer., there is insufficient evidence to support the use of monotherapy for advanced gastric cancer in patients with advanced gric cancer. there is no evidence that monotherapy or monotherapy is superior to monotherapy in terms of quality of life and time to progression in patients treated with monotherapy and no evidence of toxicity or toxicity in patients receiving monotherapy<sep> monotherapy does not appear to be superior to the treatment of patients with metastatic gastric cancers. no evidence is available to support monotherapy as a standard treatment for advanced gastric cancer but no evidence for toxicity or toxicities is available.
84,children with all treated with csf benefit from shorter hospitalisation and fewer infections. however there was no evidence of shortened duration of neutropenia nor fewer treatment delays. there was also no useful information about survival. the role of csf in the context of febrile neutropenia episodes is still uncertain. although current data show statistical benefit with csf use substantial heterogeneity between included trials does not allow this conclusion.,there is insufficient evidence to support the use of g-csf in the treatment of children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of g-csf as an adjunctive therapy for acute lymphoblastic leukemia all. however there is a need for further well-designed controlled trials to assess the effects of this intervention on mortality and quality of life outcomes in patients with acute lymphoplastic leukemia and to determine the optimal regimen for this type of treatment.
85,the available rct evidence suggests that repeated treatment of non-ischaemic mo secondary to brvo with the anti-vegf agent ranibizumab may improve clinical and visual outcomes at six and 12 months. however the frequency of re-treatment has not yet been determined and the impact of prior or combined treatment with laser photocoagulation on the primary outcome is unclear. results from ongoing studies should assess not only treatment efficacy but also the number of injections needed for maintenance and long-term safety and the effect of any prior treatment.,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of intravitreal bevacizumab in patients with cystoid macular edema., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the routine use of ranibizumab injections for the treatment of macular edema after brvo. further research is required to determine the optimal dose and route of administration for this treatment and to compare the efficacy and safety of different injections for macular ophthalmology following brvo and to determine whether the injections should be used as an adjunct to other injections for treating macular ipsugab injections.
86,oral corticosteroids at prednisolone-equivalent dose of 1 to 2 mg/kg alternate days appear to slow progression of lung disease in cf benefit should be weighed against occurrence of adverse events. risk-benefit analysis of low-dose alternate days corticosteroids is important and the short-term use of oral corticosteroids should be better evaluated.,there is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of prednisolone for the treatment of cystic fibrosis., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of corticosteroids in cystic fibrosis. however there is a need for further well-designed controlled trials with adequate follow-up to assess the efficacy and safety of oral prednisone therapy. these trials should be powered to detect clinically important changes in pulmonary function and progression of lung disease and should be adequately powered to assess clinically important outcomes.
87,three updates of this review have resulted in more included studies and more people randomised but still relatively little useful additional data. the results remain inconclusive. the new trials all compare the omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids in particular eicosapentaenoic acid and its ester ethyl-eicosapentaenoic acid. the use of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids for schizophrenia still remains experimental and this review highlights the need for large well designed conducted and reported studies.,there is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to support the use of e-epa in the treatment of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder., eicosapentaenoic acid is effective in treating dyskinesia in people with td but there is insufficient evidence to support its use as an adjuvant for people with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorders. there is a need for further well-designed controlled trials with adequate follow-up to determine the optimal dose and duration of treatment.
88,there is a lack of studies evaluating the role of aromatherapy for pain management in labour. further research is needed before recommendations can be made for clinical practice.,there is no evidence to support or refute the use of aromatherapy during labour. further research is needed to determine the optimal use of this technique for vaginal delivery., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of aromatherapy during labour for the prevention of pregnancy-associated adverse effects. further trials are needed to confirm the efficacy and safety of this intervention for prevention of adverse effects in labour. note the six citations in the awaiting classification section of the review may alter the conclusions of the reviewed review once assessed.
89,the limited available evidence suggests folate may have a potential role as a supplement to other treatment for depression. it is currently unclear if this is the case both for people with normal folate levels and for those with folate deficiency.,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of folic acid in the treatment of depression or schizophrenia., folic acid is an effective treatment for depression and schizophrenia. there is insufficient evidence to recommend its use as an add-on treatment for people with acute depression or schizophrenia. further research is required to determine the optimal dose and duration of treatment for acute depression and other types of depression disorders in people with mild to moderate depression and/or schizophrenia and to assess the effects of other types and types of antidepressants.
90,based on two small trials there was no significant difference in pain relief in women receiving oral analgesics compared with placebo or no treatment 129 women md 3.51 95 ci 10.03 to 3.01). we consider this evidence to be of a low to moderate quality. in routine clinical practice intracervical injection of local anaesthetic with a vasoconstrictor lignocaine plus adrenaline or prilocaine plus felypressin appears to be the optimum analgesia for treatment. however further high-quality adequately powered trials should be undertaken in order to provide the data necessary to estimate the efficacy of oral analgesics the optimal route of administration and dose of local anaesthetics.,there is insufficient evidence to support the use of local anaesthetic in cervical surgery. there is no evidence that local anaesthesia reduces pain or discomfort in women undergoing cervical biopsy., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of local anaesthetic injection of the cervix for cervical biopsy for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. the results of this review suggest that local anaesthesia may be effective for reducing pain associated with cervical surgery for cervix. however the results are based on a small number of studies with a small sample size and are insufficient to make any recommendations for practice.
91,some outcomes may be amenable to psychosocial treatments however there is insufficient evidence to recommend practice changes. further research on interventions described in this review is required including attention to timing duration setting and administering discipline(s as well as treatment across care settings. to facilitate future evaluations a core outcome set including patient-reported outcomes such as quality of life and compliance should be established for hip fracture trials.,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of exercise as an intervention for the prevention of hip fracture., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of multiple-component interventions for hip fracture in older people. there is a need for further well-designed and reported trials to assess the effectiveness and safety of these interventions in improving functional outcomes for older people with hip fracture. future research should focus on improving the quality of life of older people who are most likely to benefit from these studies and on improving their ability to perform daily living.
92,available evidence suggests that interventions to increase use of booster seats among children age four to eight years are effective. combining incentives booster seat discount coupons or gift certificates or distribution of free booster seats with education demonstrated marked beneficial outcomes for acquisition and use of booster seats for four to eight year olds. there is some evidence of beneficial effect of legislation on acquisition and use of booster seats but this was mainly from uncontrolled before-and-after studies which did not meet the criteria for inclusion in the meta-analysis.,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of safety restraints in children attending preschool. further research is needed., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the effectiveness of interventions aimed at reducing adverse effects of intervention aimed at preschool children. there is a need for further high quality trials to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of interventions targeting preschool children with pre-existing adverse effects. such trials should focus on improving the quality of life of preschool children as well as on the cost-effectiveness of interventions aiming at prevention of adverse effects on adverse effects such as adverse effects and adverse events.
93,preliminary studies suggest benefit from blood alkalinisation with nahco3 in op poisoning but there is insufficient evidence to support its routine clinical use. further research is required to determine the method of alkalinisation that will optimise outcomes and the regimen which will produce the target arterial ph of 7.50 range 7.45 to 7.55). this should be followed by a well-designed randomised controlled trial to determine efficacy.,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of sodium bicarbonate in the treatment of op poisoning., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the routine use of sodium bicarbonate in the treatment of organophosphorous pesticide poisoning. further trials are needed to confirm the efficacy and safety of this intervention in the management of op poisoning. these trials should be conducted in high-income countries with low incidence of adverse events such as adverse effects and adverse effects.
94,there are too few data available to make definitive recommendations. more intensive forms of advance directive appear to show promise but currently practice must be guided by evidence other than that derived from randomised trials. more trials are indicated to determine whether higher intensity interventions such as joint crisis planning have an effect on outcomes of clinical relevance.,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of the mental health act for the treatment of people with mental illness. further research is needed., there is currently insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of advance directives for mental health care in people with serious mental illnesses. we recommend that advance directives be used as an alternative to compulsory readmissions in order to reduce the number of days spent in hospital and reduce the rate of hospital readmissions. we suggest that future research should focus on improving the quality of life of people with severe mental illnesses and on assessing the effects of these interventions on people with schizophrenia.
95,this review demonstrates a significant decrease in the incidence of symptomatic pda following treatment of an asymptomatic pda with indomethacin. there is also a small but statistically significant decrease in the duration of requirement for supplemental oxygen. there are no reported long term outcomes in the included trials and so it is not possible to comment on possible long term effects. further studies are required to determine the long term benefits or harms of closing a pda prior to the onset of symptoms.,there is insufficient evidence to support the use of indomethacin in the treatment of patent ductus arteriosus., prophylactic closure of the patent ductus arteriosus pda reduces the risk of bronchopulmonary dysplasia and death in preterm infants with pda. however there is insufficient evidence to support the use of this intervention in very low birthweight infants with severe obstructive pda who are at high risk of developing pda or pda and there are insufficient data to support its use in extremely low birth weight infants.
96,long acting inhaled beta-agonists have advantages across a wide range of physiological and clinical outcomes for regular treatment.,the is insufficient evidence to support the use of salbutamol as an inhaled corticosteroid for asthma., ra-adrenoceptor agonists are effective in improving lung function and reducing the risk of serious adverse events in patients with mild to moderate asthma. ra2-agonists is effective in reducing the rate of inhaled bronchodilator use in adults with moderate to severe asthma but there is insufficient evidence to support the use of RA2-agonist formsoterol in patients who are allergic to inhaled corticosteroids in monotherapy and to support a reduction in serious adverse effects in adults and children with severe asthma.
97,studies were generally small and very few studies were done in developing countries. there was a lack of studies truly looking at the effect of home based care itself or looking at significant end points death and progression to aids). however the range of interventions and hbc models evaluated can assist in making evidence-based decisions about hiv care and support.,there is insufficient evidence to support the use of home-based care for hiv-infected women., home-based nursing interventions are effective in improving quality of life in hiv-infected patients. there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the effectiveness of this intervention. there are insufficient data to support the use of home based nursing interventions for hiv/aids. future research should focus on improving the quality and quantity of life of hiv patients in areas where hiv is not prevalent.
98,risperidone can be beneficial in some features of autism. however there are limited data available from studies with small sample sizes. in addition there lacks a single standardised outcome measure allowing adequate comparison of studies and long-term followup is also lacking. further research is necessary to determine the efficacy pf risperidone in clinical practice.,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of risperidone for the treatment of autism in children., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the routine use of risperidone as a treatment for people with autism. there is a need for further well-designed controlled trials to evaluate the effectiveness of risp as a therapeutic treatment for children with autism and other pervasive developmental disorders. such trials should be conducted with adequate follow-up to assess the efficacy and safety of these interventions.
99,we found no conclusive evidence to determine whether ids between cycles of chemotherapy would improve or decrease the survival rates of women with advanced ovarian cancer compared with conventional treatment of primary surgery followed by adjuvant chemotherapy. ids appeared to yield benefit only in women whose primary surgery was not performed by gynaecologic oncologists or was less extensive. data on qol and adverse events were inconclusive.,there is insufficient evidence to support the use of secondary cytoreductive surgery for ovarian cancer., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the routine use of preoperative surgery for advanced ovarian cancer. however there is a need for further well-designed trials to evaluate the effects of preop surgery on progression-free survival and overall survival in women with advanced ovarian carcinoma. these trials should focus on women with moderate to severe residual disease and on women who are at high risk of complications and/or death.
100,in contrast to the previous version of this review our results suggest that therapeutic ultrasound may be beneficial for patients with osteoarthritis of the knee. because of the low quality of the evidence we are uncertain about the magnitude of the effects on pain relief and function however. therapeutic ultrasound is widely used for its potential benefits on both knee pain and function which may be clinically relevant. appropriately designed trials of adequate power are therefore warranted.,there is evidence that isokinetic exercise may be effective in reducing knee pain in patients with knee osteoarthritis., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of ultrasound for knee osteoarthritis oa. there is a need for further well-designed and reported trials to evaluate the effects of ultrasound on knee range of motion and to determine whether ultrasound is an effective treatment for knee oa with respect to improving functional status and disability in patients with knee oae. the results of this review suggest that ultrasound may be effective in improving knee range and disability but further research is required to determine the optimal treatment for this condition.
101,the results of this review give some support to ciclesonide as an equivalent therapy to other ics at similar nominal doses. the studies assessed low doses of steroids in patients whose asthma required treatment with low doses of steroids. at half the dose of fp and bdp/bud the effects of ciclesonide were more inconsistent the effect on candidiasis may be of importance to people who find this to be problematic. the role of ciclesonide in the management of asthma requires further study especially in paediatric patients. further assessment against fp at a dose ratio of 1:2 is a priority.,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of corticosteroids in the treatment of patients with persistent asthma., ciclesonide and budesonide are both effective in reducing the need for rescue medication in adults and children with mild to moderate asthma. there is insufficient evidence to support the use of these two drugs in adults with asthma. however there are insufficient data to support their use in children with severe asthma. we recommend that future trials should be conducted to determine the optimal dose and duration of use for these two types of ics.
102,for most red flags there is insufficient evidence to provide recommendations regarding their diagnostic accuracy or usefulness for detecting spinal malignancy. the available evidence indicates that in patients with lbp an indication of spinal malignancy should not be based on the results of one single red flag question. further research to evaluate the performance of different combinations of tests is recommended.,there is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to support the use of rcts in the treatment of acute low back pain., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of ics for the treatment of musculoskeletal pain in people aged 50 years or older. we recommend that ics should be used as part of routine clinical practice. we suggest that future trials should focus on patients with a history of neoplastic disorders and on those patients with an existing history of neurological disorders. we also recommend that future studies should include long-term follow-up.
103,there is evidence that tranexamic acid reduces blood transfusion in patients undergoing emergency or urgent surgery. there is a need for a large pragmatic clinical trial to assess the effects of routine use of tranexamic acid on mortality in a heterogeneous group of patients receiving urgent and emergency surgery.,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of tranexamic acid for the treatment of hip fracture., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the routine use of erythrocyte in the treatment of isolated isolated hip fractures. further trials are needed to determine the optimal dose and duration of eriesthrocytes in isolated hip fracture surgery. these trials should be conducted in high-income countries with low risk of bias and should be powered to detect clinically important adverse effects.
104,there is no evidence that community-based screening of asymptomatic older people results in improvements in vision.,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of screening for people with visual impairment in primary care. there is a need for further research., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of screening programmes for people with visual acuity in primary care. there is evidence that screening programmes are effective in reducing the risk of falling in people aged 75 years or older. however the evidence is based on a small number of studies with low risk of bias and is insufficient to make any recommendations for practice. future research should focus on improving the quality of life of people with vision acuity.
105,community-based interventions and antenatal contraceptive counselling improved uptake of copper iud contraception. since the copper iud is one of the most effective reversible contraceptive methods primary care and family planning and practitioners could consider adopting these interventions. although our review suggests these interventions are clinically effective a cost-benefit analysis may be required to evaluate applicability.,the is insufficient evidence to determine whether individualized contraceptive counseling is effective in improving contraceptive uptake in women in rural areas., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of contraceptive advice for women who have undergone abortion. there is a need for further research to investigate the effectiveness of contraceptive counseling for women with a history of adverse effects. the findings of this review suggest that the use and safety of contraceptive counselling for women using contraceptive methods should be evaluated in future studies.
106,intensive reminders and implementation intention interventions appear promising in enhancing adherence to antiepileptic mediations however we need more reliable evidence on their efficacy from carefully designed randomised controlled trials before a firm conclusion can be reached.,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of motivational interviewing in epilepsy patients. further research is needed to determine the effectiveness and safety of such interventions., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of interventions to improve adherence to treatment in epilepsy. however there is a need for further high quality randomised controlled trials to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions for epilepsy. such trials should be conducted in people with epilepsy with seizure type and frequency and should be of high methodological quality. future trials should focus on outcomes that are clinically relevant to patients with epilepsy such as quality of life and cost-effectiveness.
107,telephone voice interventions may have a role in improving medication adherence reducing risky sexual behaviour and reducing depressive and psychiatric symptoms but current evidence is sparse and further research is needed.,there is insufficient evidence to support the use of telephone-delivered psychotherapy for hiv-positive people in rural areas., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of telephone-delivered interventions for hiv-infected persons in rural areas of the united states. however there is a need for further research to investigate the effectiveness of these interventions in hiv/aids in reducing depressive symptoms and improving quality of life in these populations. future research should focus on improving the quality and quantity of the studies and on identifying the most effective interventions to improve the quality of the trials.
108,treating simple corneal abrasions with a patch does not improve healing rates on the first day post-injury and does not reduce pain. in addition use of patches results in a loss of binocular vision. therefore it is recommended that patches should not be used for simple corneal abrasions. further research should focus on large greater than 10 mm2 abrasions.,there is insufficient evidence to support the use of eye patching in the treatment of corneal abrasions., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of topical antibiotics for corneal abrasion. however there is evidence that topical antibiotics may be effective in treating traumatic corneaal epithelial abrasions. there is no evidence to suggest that topical antibiotic treatment is effective in preventing eye pain. there are no studies investigating the effect of topical antibiotic treatments on corneally abrabrasion and there is a need for further trials.
109,no significant differences were found between triflusal and aspirin for secondary prevention of serious vascular events in patients with stroke or tia and ami. however our review cannot exclude moderate differences in efficacy. triflusal was associated with a lower risk of hemorrhagic complications.,there is no evidence that triflusal reduces the risk of stroke or ischemic infarction in patients with tia., triflusal is effective in the prevention of acute myocardial infarction and is associated with a reduction in vascular events but there is no evidence of a reduction of vascular events. there is a need for revascularization in patients with severe angina. there are insufficient data to draw any conclusions about the effect on vascular events in people with mild ischemic stroke or tia. further trials are required to determine the effect of antplatelet agents on the incidence of major vascular events and to determine whether they are effective in patients who are at high risk of vascular complications.
110,in order to eliminate potential selection bias more rcts need to be conducted in this area so that effectiveness as well as efficacy can be ascertained. the interlock programme appears to be effective while the device is installed in the vehicle of the offender. studies need to address ways of improving recidivism rates in the long term as the major challenges are participation rates compliance and durability.,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of ignition interlocks in the management of impaired driving., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of alcohol interlock restrictions for alcohol-related traffic offences. we recommend that the development of an intervention to reduce alcohol traffic violations should be undertaken in the context of rigorous randomised controlled trials with adequate sample sizes and adequate follow-up. trials should be conducted to determine the optimal intervention and to compare the effectiveness of interventions to prevent alcohol traffic offences in alcohol traffic offenses.
111,one study suggested that topical ketanserin is more effective than clioquinol cream or zinc paste. topical phenytoin two studies may be more effective than saline dressing regarding ulcer healing. for the other dressings the results were equivocal. canvas shoes were a little better than pvc-boots but not significantly and the effect of double rocker shoes compared to below-knee plasters was no different in promoting the healing of ulcers. no side effects were documented. there is a lack of high quality research in the field of ulcer prevention and treatment in leprosy. new trials should follow the current standards for design and reporting of randomised controlled trials.,the is insufficient evidence to support the use of phenytoin in leprosy. there is a need for further trials to evaluate the effectiveness of the combination of the two therapies., topical phenytoin is effective in reducing ulcer volume reduction in leprosy ulcers but there is insufficient evidence to recommend its use as an alternative to normal saline for the treatment of plantar ulcers. there is a need for further well-designed and reported trials to evaluate the effectiveness of topical povidone iodine for the management of simple ulcers in people with severe trophic ulcers and to determine the optimal route of administration for the prevention of severe ulcer infection.
112,there is no evidence to suggest that spinal manipulation is effective in the treatment of dysmenorrhoea. in the one trial reporting on adverse effects there was no greater risk of such events with spinal compared with sham manipulation.,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of spinal manipulation in the treatment of primary dysmenorrhea., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of spinal manipulation for primary dysmenorrhea. there is a need for further well-designed randomised controlled trials with adequate sample sizes to evaluate the effects of spinal manipulative therapy on primary dysmanorrhea and to compare the effects on secondary dysmenorhea with placebo and other non-surgical treatments.
113,a single injection of btb was effective and safe for treating cervical dystonia. long-term uncontrolled studies suggested that further injection cycles continue to work for most patients. future research should explore technical factors such as the optimum treatment intervals and use of image or electromyographic guidance for administration. other issues include service delivery quality of life long-term efficacy and safety and the relative indications for bta btb and other treatments such as deep brain stimulation,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of botulinum toxin type b for cervical dystonia., botulinum toxin type b bont/b is effective in treating cervical dystonia cd. however there is insufficient evidence to recommend its use as an adjuvant for women with idiopathic cervix. further trials are needed to determine its safety and efficacy. note the four citations in the awaiting classification section of the review may alter our conclusions once assessed. future trials should focus on improving the quality of life of women with cd.
114,prior to the current update it appeared there was some evidence that cranberry juice may decrease the number of symptomatic utis over a 12 month period particularly for women with recurrent utis. the addition of 14 further studies suggests that cranberry juice is less effective than previously indicated. although some of small studies demonstrated a small benefit for women with recurrent utis there were no statistically significant differences when the results of a much larger study were included. cranberry products were not significantly different to antibiotics for preventing utis in three small studies. given the large number of dropouts/withdrawals from studies mainly attributed to the acceptability of consuming cranberry products particularly juice over long periods and the evidence that the benefit for preventing uti is small cranberry juice cannot currently be recommended for the prevention of utis. other preparations such as powders need to be quantified using standardised methods to ensure the potency and contain enough of the active ingredient before being evaluated in clinical studies or recommended for use.,there is insufficient evidence to support the use of cranberry juice in the prevention of uti in women., there is insufficient evidence to support the use of cranberry juice as an antibiotic prophylaxis in the prevention of symptomatic utis in people with sci. there is no evidence to suggest that it is associated with a reduction in bacteriuria in patients with sci but there is evidence of a decrease in urinary tract infection in people who are at increased risk of developing urinary tract infections. there are no studies available for other types of antibiotics.
115,we found low-level evidence for the use of teriflunomide as a disease-modifying therapy for ms due to the limited quality of the available rcts. we did not conduct meta-analysis because of the clinical and methodological diversity of the included studies. short-term teriflunomide 7 or 14 mg alone or with add-on ifn-β was safe for patients with relapsing ms. both teriflunomide 7 and 14 mg alone had potential benefits for patients with relapsing forms of ms. we are waiting for the publication of ongoing trials. rcts with high methodological quality and longer periods of observation are needed to assess safety disability progression neuroprotection and quality of life.,there is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to support the use of anticoagulants for the treatment of multiple sclerosis., oral teriflunomide is an effective treatment for relapsing rms in people with rms. however there is insufficient evidence to recommend its use as an add-on treatment for rms because of its adverse effects and adverse effects. further trials are needed to determine the optimal dose and duration of treatment and to assess the efficacy and safety of other add-ons for multiple sclerosis types.
116,continuous monitoring of physiological variables for the first two to three days may improve outcomes and prevent complications. attention to the changes in physiological variables is a key feature of a stroke unit and can most likely be aided by continuous monitoring without complications related to immobility or to treatments triggered by the relief of abnormal physiological variables. well-designed high-quality studies are needed because many questions remain open and deserve further research. these include when to start continuous monitoring when to interrupt it which people should be given priority and which treatments are most appropriate after the identification of abnormalities in physiological variables.,there is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to support the use of cam in the treatment of acute ischemic stroke., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of pre-treatment interventions for acute stroke patients. there is a need for well-designed adequately powered randomised controlled trials with adequate follow-up to assess the effects of pretreatment interventions on stroke outcomes. such trials should be conducted in the context of well designed adequately powered adequately powered placebo-controlled trials.
117,varenicline and behavioural interventions may help st users to quit. behavioural interventions incorporating telephone counselling or an oral examination are likely to increase abstinence rates.,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of nicotine patches for st. there is no evidence that nicotine patches are effective in preventing st., there is insufficient evidence to support the use of smokeless tobacco st users to quit but there is no evidence to suggest that the cessation of st users is associated with a reduction in st use. we are unable to draw any conclusions because of the lack of evidence for other types of tobacco cessation in the studies included in this review. we recommend that future studies should be conducted to determine the best methods of support for st users and to compare the effectiveness of different types of support and methods for reducing st users.
118,dse may perform better than mps but additional studies directly comparing these cardiac screening tests are needed. absence of significant cad may not necessarily correlate with cardiac-event free survival following transplantation. further research should focus on assessing the ability of functional tests to predict postoperative outcome.,there is insufficient evidence to support the use of coronary angiography in patients with end-stage renal disease. further randomised controlled trials are needed., dobutamine stress echocardiography dse and dse are more sensitive than cimt and are associated with increased risk of cardiovascular events in patients with end-stage renal disease. dse may be associated with decreased risk of cardiotoxicity in patients who have normal thallium imaging and decreased risk for cardiovascular events. the risk of stroke is increased with dse but is associated with reduced risk of coronary angiographic and decreased risks of stroke in those patients with normal thickness.
119,the risk of stroke and death did not differ significantly between the two types of anaesthetic technique during carotid endarterectomy. this review provides evidence to support a policy that patients and surgeons can choose either anaesthetic technique depending on the clinical situation and their own preferences.,there is insufficient evidence to support the use of local anaesthesia for carotid endarterectomy. there is no evidence to suggest that general anaesthesia is superior to local anaesthetic in terms of adverse events., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of anaesthesia for carotid endarterectomy under local anaesthesia. there is no evidence to suggest that anaesthesia is superior to general anaesthesia in reducing the risk of myocardial ischemia or stroke in patients with cotid ischemias. there are insufficient data to make any recommendations for practice. future research should focus on improving the quality of life of patients with carotids endartèrectomy.
120,this updated review shows that custom-made foot orthoses are significantly more beneficial than sham orthoses for treating foot pain associated with pes cavus in a variety of clinical populations. we also show that some secondary biomechanical outcomes improve with custom-made foot orthoses and footwear but not with botulinum toxin or off-the-shelf foot orthoses. there is an absence of evidence for any other type of intervention for the treatment or prevention of pes cavus.,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of orthotic foot orthotics for the treatment of cavus., <interventions> botulinum toxin type a bont-a is effective in treating cavus foot pain in people with a cavus type 1a. there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of any of the interventions in this type of foot pain. further research is required to determine the optimal treatment for cavus feet.
121,massage might be beneficial for patients with subacute and chronic non-specific low-back pain especially when combined with exercises and education. the evidence suggests that acupuncture massage is more effective than classic massage but this need confirmation. more studies are needed to confirm these conclusions to assess the impact of massage on return-to-work and to determine cost-effectiveness of massage as an intervention for low-back pain.,there is insufficient evidence to support the use of massage therapy in the treatment of chronic low-back pain. there is a need for further research., massage therapy is an effective treatment for low-back pain in people with subacute and sub-acute conditions. there is insufficient evidence to support the use of massage therapy as a treatment for non-specific low-b pain in patients with low-pills. however there is a need for further well-designed trials to investigate the effectiveness of massage therapies for low back pain in low-outcomes.
122,there is weak evidence that the interventions fr-4 with lip-seal training and palatal crib associated with high-pull chincup are able to correct anterior open bite. given that the trials included have potential bias these results must be viewed with caution. recommendations for clinical practice cannot be made based only on the results of these trials. more randomised controlled trials are needed to elucidate the interventions for treating anterior open bite.,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of acrylic posterior bite-blocks in the treatment of skeletal anterior open bite malocclusion., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of any of the interventions reviewed in this review. further trials are needed to confirm the efficacy and safety of various interventions for the treatment of skeletal anterior open bite malocclusion and to evaluate the effectiveness of other interventions such as the fr-4 appliance. future trials should evaluate the efficacy of interventions for this condition and should include long-term follow-up.
123,the overall quality of evidence was moderate. half of these postpartum interventions led to fewer repeat pregnancies or births or more contraceptive use. however the evidence of intervention effectiveness was of low to moderate quality. trials with evidence of effectiveness included two that provided one or two sessions and three that had multiple contacts. the former had limitations such as self-reported outcomes and showing no effect for many comparisons. the interventions with multiple sessions were promising but would have to be adapted for other locations and then retested. researchers and health care providers will have to determine which intervention might be appropriate for their setting and level of resources.,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of postpartum contraceptive education in women with pre-pregnancy pregnancies., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of home-based contraceptives for preventing repeat pregnancy among women in low-income countries. there is a need for high quality trials to investigate the effectiveness of home based contraceptives for prevention of repeat pregnancy in women with prentice and other types of pregnancy. there are insufficient studies to evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of homebased contraceptives.
124,prophylactic systemic antibiotics in neonates with a central venous catheter reduces the rate of proven or suspected septicaemia. however this may not be clinically important in the face of no significant difference in overall mortality and the lack of data on long-term neurodevelopmental outcome. furthermore there is a lack of data pertaining to the potentially significant disadvantages of this approach such as the selection of resistant organisms. the routine use of prophylactic antibiotics in infants with central venous catheters in neonatal units cannot currently be recommended.,there is insufficient evidence to support the use of prophylactic amoxicillin in the treatment of infants with central venous silicone elastomer catheters., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the routine prophylaxis of parenteral nutrition for preterm infants with staphylococcal sepsis. there is a need for adequately powered randomised controlled trials with adequate follow-up to determine the optimal antibiotic regimen for this condition. such trials should be conducted in low birthweight infants with low birth weight infants.
125,in view of methodological deficiencies and limited number of individual studies we have found no reliable evidence to support the routine use of vitamins in patients with epilepsy. further trials are needed especially to assess the utility of vitamin d supplementation to prevent osteomalacia and the role of vitamin e on seizures and thiamine in improving cognitive functions.,there is insufficient evidence to support the use of folate in the treatment of epileptic patients with epilepsy., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of folic acid for the prevention of gingival hyperplasia in people with phenytoin-induced osteomalacia. there is a need for further trials to investigate the efficacy of vitamin e for the developmentally disabled in people who are at high risk of seizures and to determine whether vitamin e is beneficial for this type of epilepsy.
126,compared to no intervention or minimal interventions pamphlets usual care interactive computer-based interventions are an effective intervention for weight loss and weight maintenance. compared to in-person interventions interactive computer-based interventions result in smaller weight losses and lower levels of weight maintenance. the amount of additional weight loss however is relatively small and of brief duration making the clinical significance of these differences unclear.,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of computer-based weight loss interventions for overweight or obese people., weight loss interventions are effective in reducing weight loss in overweight and obesity in people at risk of type 2 diabetes </interventions> there is insufficient evidence to support the use of internet-based weight loss programmes for weight-loss maintenance in people who are at increased risk of diabetes. there are insufficient data to support weight loss programs for weight loss. there is a need for more studies to evaluate the effects of weight loss on weight loss outcomes and to investigate the effects on cardiovascular morbidity.
127,aldosterone antagonists contribute to reduction of proteinuria in patients with ckd who are already on acei and arb but increase the risk of hyperkalaemia. available studies are small and have short follow-up. long-term effects on renal outcomes mortality and safety are unknown.,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of spironolactone in patients with diabetic nephropathy. further trials are needed., usep> spironolactone and angiotensin-converting enzyme antagonists are effective in reducing albuminuria and reducing blood pressure in patients with non-diabetic nephropathy but there is insufficient evidence to support their use in this patient group. there is a need for further well-designed randomised controlled trials to evaluate the effects of these agents on blood pressure and blood pressure.
128,based on this analysis the most prudent prescription for water intake to premature infants would seem to be careful restriction of water intake so that physiological needs are met without allowing significant dehydration. this practice could be expected to decrease the risks of patent ductus arteriosus and necrotizing enterocolitis without significantly increasing the risk of adverse consequences.,there is insufficient evidence to determine whether or not fluid restriction reduces the risk of bronchopulmonary dysplasia in preterm infants., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of fluid restriction in preterm infants with patent ductus arteriosus and congestive heart failure. there is a need for well-designed adequately powered trials to evaluate the effects of fluids restriction on mortality and morbidity in premature infants with prelabour dysplasia. such trials should be conducted in high-volume groups with low and low-volume infants.
129,improvement in control of maternal blood pressure with use of beta-blockers would be worthwhile only if it were reflected in substantive benefits for mother and/or baby and none have been clearly demonstrated. the effect of beta-blockers on perinatal outcome is uncertain the worrying trend to an increase in sga infants is partly dependent on one small outlying trial. large randomised trials are needed to determine whether antihypertensive therapy in general rather than beta-blocker therapy specifically results in greater benefit than risk for treatment of mild-moderate pregnancy hypertension. if so then it would be appropriate to consider which antihypertensive is best and beta-blockers should be evaluated. note the seventeen reports in the awaiting classification section of the review may alter the conclusions of the review once assessed.,there is insufficient evidence to support the use of methyldopa for the prevention of pregnancy induced hypertension in pregnant women., there is insufficient evidence to support the use of antihypertensive drugs during pregnancy to reduce the risk of preterm birth in women with pre-eclampsia and prelabetalol and pindol-hydralazine for women with mild to moderate hypertension during pregnancy. no studies were found to have a significant effect on neonatal outcome in women who were treated with non-pharmacological drugs.
130,in patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis whose disease is refractory to conventional treatment using corticosteroids and/or immunosuppressive agents infliximab is effective in inducing clinical remission inducing clinical response promoting mucosal healing and reducing the need for colectomy at least in the short term. serious adverse events attributable to infliximab were not common in the included studies but physicians should be aware of and be prepared to deal with potential adverse events such as anaphylactic reactions and infections.,the is insufficient evidence to determine whether infliximab is effective in treating steroid-refractory ulcerative colitis., infliximab is an effective and safe treatment for ulcerative colitis. however there is insufficient evidence to support its use as an adjunctive treatment for patients with ulceration colitis or to support the use of other anti-tnf alpha therapies. further trials are required to determine the optimal dose and duration of treatment and to evaluate the efficacy and safety of other antifractory agents. these trials should be adequately powered and adequately powered.
131,the evidence from the limited number of studies suggests that psychological and educational interventions may result in increased abstinence from alcohol and a reduction in alcohol consumption among pregnant women. however results were not consistent and the paucity of studies the number of total participants the high risk of bias of some of the studies and the complexity of interventions limits our ability to determine the type of intervention which would be most effective in increasing abstinence from or reducing the consumption of alcohol among pregnant women.,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of motivational interviewing in the management of alcohol use during pregnancy., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of motivational interviewing as an intervention to reduce alcohol consumption in pregnant women. however there is a need for well-designed adequately powered trials with adequate sample sizes to assess the effects of motivational interview on alcohol consumption on pregnancy outcomes. such trials should be conducted in pregnancy women with low risk of antepartum alcohol consumption.
132,the findings of our work indicate that polyethylene glycol is better than lactulose in outcomes of stool frequency per week form of stool relief of abdominal pain and the need for additional products. on subgroup analysis this is seen in both adults and children except for relief of abdominal pain. polyethylene glycol should be used in preference to lactulose in the treatment of chronic constipation.,there is insufficient evidence to determine whether lactulose or polyethylene glycol is effective in relieving constipation in children., polyethylene glycol 3350/electrolyte is more efficacious than lactulose and is associated with fewer adverse events than lactulinose. however the clinical significance of these adverse events is uncertain and further trials are required to determine the optimal combination of these agents for the management of constipation in people with chronic idiopathic constipation. future trials should include adequately powered randomised controlled trials with adequate follow-up to assess the efficacy and safety of different types of hydrolysates for treating constipation and to compare the effects of different hydrolytes.
133,available evidence nevertheless suggests that compared with standard care or no intervention behavioral interventions are effective in reducing hiv and the incidence of stis amongst female sex workers fsws). given the benefits of social cognitive theory and the promotion of condom use in reducing hiv/sti and the public health need to control transmission amongst fsws there is a clear finding in favour of behavioral interventions. however it should be recognized that there is a lack of information about most other outcomes and target populations and that all of the trials were conducted in low and middle-income countries.,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of sex workers as sex workers in the context of hiv prevention programmes., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of male condoms for prevention of hiv infection in the sex workers in africa. there is a need for more studies to investigate the effectiveness of male condom promotion strategies for hiv prevention in women sex workers. there are insufficient studies to assess the effectiveness and safety of male and female condom promotion for prevention among hiv-based sex workers and there is no evidence to suggest that women should be encouraged to use male condoms to prevent hiv.
134,with its lower complication rate in comparison with intramedullary nails and absence of functional outcome data to the contrary the shs appears superior for trochanteric fractures. further studies are required to confirm whether more recently developed designs of intramedullary nail avoid the complications of previous nails. intramedullary nails may have advantages over fixed angle plates for subtrochanteric and some unstable trochanteric fractures but further studies are required.,there is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of a sliding hip screw for the prevention of fractures of the proximal femur in elderly patients., intertrochanteric femoral fractures of the femoral and hip fractures are associated with a decreased risk of peri-operative complications and a decreased need for blood transfusions and a reduced risk of postoperative complications. there is insufficient evidence to support the use of a high-pressure screw-plate for extramedullary hip fractures in elderly patients.
135,this review shows a beneficial effect of ews in time to recurrence percentage of people hospitalised and functioning in people with bipolar disorder. however the absence of data on the primary outcome measure in so many included studies is a source of concern and a potential source of bias. mental health services should consider routinely providing ews interventions to adults with bipolar disorder as they appear to reduce hospitalisation and therefore may be cost-effective.,there is insufficient evidence to support the use of psychosocial interventions for bipolar disorder. there is a need for more well-designed well-conducted randomised controlled trials., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of psychosocial interventions for bipolar disorder. there is a need for further well-designed and reported trials to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of these interventions in bipolar disorder and to assess the effects of psychotherapy on other outcomes such as mood disorders and relapse rates. future research should focus on the development of long-term interventions for people with bipolar disorder as well as on improving the quality of life of people with a disorder.
136,this review suggests that the use of fluoride supplements is associated with a reduction in caries increment when compared with no fluoride supplement in permanent teeth. the effect of fluoride supplements was unclear on deciduous teeth. when compared with the administration of topical fluorides no differential effect was observed. we rated 10 trials as being at unclear risk of bias and one at high risk of bias and therefore the trials provide weak evidence about the efficacy of fluoride supplements.,there is insufficient evidence to draw firm conclusions about the effect of fluoride supplements on caries in children with cleft lip and palate., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of fluoride supplements in children with high caries risk. there is a need for further well-designed and reported trials to evaluate the effects of fluoride supplementation on adverse effects in children. the results should be interpreted with caution because of the small number of studies included in this review and the small sample sizes of the included studies.
137,generally fluoroquinolones performed well in treating typhoid and maybe superior to alternatives in some settings. however we were unable to draw firm general conclusions on comparative contemporary effectiveness given that resistance changes over time and many studies were small. policy makers and clinicians need to consider local resistance patterns in choosing a fluoroquinolone or alternative. there is some evidence that the newest fluoroquinolone gatifloxacin remains effective in some regions where resistance to older fluoroquinolones has developed. however the different fluoroquinolones have not been compared directly in trials in these settings.,there is insufficient evidence to support the use of oral antibiotics for typhoid fever in children and adults. further trials are needed to determine whether oral antibiotics are more effective than oral antibiotics., there is insufficient evidence to support the use of iprofloxic acid-resistant enteric fever in people with s. typhi and gatifloxacin as monidrug-resistant typhoid in adults and children. there is no evidence to suggest that the combination of azithromycin and poxy-oxyacin is more effective than the combination in treating people with mdr-resistant or nalidixic acid resistant enteric fe in adults.

139,dopamine is more effective than dobutamine in the short term treatment of systemic hypotension in preterm infants. there was no evidence of an effect on the incidence of adverse neuroradiological sequelae severe periventricular haemorrhage and/or periventricular leucomalacia or on the incidence of tachycardia. however in the absence of data confirming long term benefit and safety of dopamine compared to dobutamine no firm recommendations can be made regarding the choice of drug to treat hypotension.,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of dopamine in preterm infants with sma., there is insufficient evidence to support the use of dobutamine in preterm infants with respiratory distress syndrome. there is a need for further well-designed controlled trials to evaluate the effects of dopamine on preterm infant outcomes such as neurodevelopmental outcome and long-term neonatal outcomes. such trials should be conducted with adequate follow-up to assess the effect of dopamine in preventing hypotension on long term outcomes. these studies should be powered to detect clinically important differences between dopamine and placebo.
140,primaquine 15 mg/day for 14 days plus chloroquine is more effective than chloroquine alone or primaquine 15 mg/day for 5 days plus chloroquine in preventing relapses of vivax malaria. primaquine five days plus chloroquine appears no better than chloroquine. countries should follow the who's recommendation for 14-day primaquine plus chloroquine regimen. alternative regimens need to be evaluated in randomized controlled trials which should also consider variations in regional p. vivax strains and the possibility of primaquine resistance reinfection and adherence in those who relapse.,there is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of chloroquine alone for the prevention of malaria relapse in people with malaria., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of primaquine for treating plasmodium vivax malaria in india. there is a need for well-designed controlled trials to determine the optimal regimen for this condition. future trials should focus on long-term outcomes such as quality of life and cost-effectiveness as well as patient-centred outcomes. trials should be conducted in low-resource settings to assess the efficacy of different regimens for this disease.
141,omega-3 fatty acids appear to have little haematological benefit in people with intermittent claudication and there is no evidence of consistently improved clinical outcomes quality of life walking distance ankle brachial pressure index or angiographic findings). supplementation may also cause adverse effects such as nausea diarrhoea and flatulence. further research is needed to evaluate fully short and long-term effects of omega-3 fatty acids on the most clinically relevant outcomes in people with intermittent claudication before they can be recommended for routine use.,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of omega-3 fatty acids in the treatment of peripheral vascular disease., omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid is effective in reducing blood pressure and reducing red cell deformability in people with peripheral arterial disease. however there is insufficient evidence to support its use as an adjunct to other therapies for people with claudication. further trials are required to determine the optimal type and duration of olep-3 pufa supplementation in patients with lower limb atherosclerosis.

143,despite methodological limitations of the evaluation studies reviewed the consistency of reported reductions in fall-related injuries across all programmes support the preliminary claim that the population-based approach to the prevention of fall-related injury is effective and can form the basis of public health practice. randomised multiple community trials of population-based interventions are indicated to increase the level of evidence in support of the population-based approach. research is also required to elucidate the barriers and facilitators in population-based interventions that influence the extent to which population programmes are effective.,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of community-based tai chi exercise for the prevention of falls in the elderly., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the effectiveness of interventions to prevent injuries among tai chi practitioners. however there is a need for well-designed and reported trials to assess the effectiveness and safety of interventions for tai tai and tai- chi prevention programmes in the prevention of injuries among people aged 65 years or older in taichung county. such trials should be conducted in low-income countries.
144,there is insufficient evidence either for or against the use of stabilisation splint therapy for the treatment of temporomandibular pain dysfunction syndrome. this review suggests the need for further well conducted rcts that pay attention to method of allocation outcome assessment large sample size and enough duration of follow up. a standardisation of the outcomes of the treatment of pds should be established in the rcts.,the is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of occlusal splint therapy for the treatment of temporomandibular dysfunction., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of any one type of treatment for tmd in patients with tmd. however there is a need for further well-designed and reported trials to evaluate the effectiveness of different types of treatment in tmd and to compare the effectiveness and safety of various types of treatments in different patients with different conditions of tmd disorders.
145,the currently available evidence suggests a pfs benefit for patients with relapsed or refractory hl after first-line therapy who are treated with hdct followed by asct compared to patients treated with conventional chemotherapy. in addition data showes a positive trend regarding os but more trials are needed to detect a significant effect. intensifying the hdct regime before hdct followed by asct did not show a difference as compared to hdct followed by asct but was associated with increased adverse events.,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of high-dose chemotherapy for patients with relapsed hodgkin's lymphoma., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of high-dose chemotherapy for hodgkin's disease. however there is a need for further well-designed randomised controlled trials to evaluate the effects of high dose chemotherapy on survival and progression-free survival in patients with relapsed hdgkin-kin lymphoma. these trials should be conducted in the context of adequate follow-up periods to determine the optimal chemotherapy regimen.
146,there were insufficient data to establish whether oral epa was better than placebo. comparisons of epa combined with a protein energy supplementation versus a protein energy supplementation without epa in the presence of an appetite stimulant megestrol acetate provided no evidence that epa improves symptoms associated with the cachexia syndrome often seen in patients with advanced cancer.,there is no evidence to support or refute the use of omega-3 fatty acids in the treatment of cancer., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of omega-3 fatty acids in the treatment of cancer-associated wasting. there is a need for further well-designed trials to evaluate the effects of omega 3 fatty acids on quality of life in patients with advanced cancer. these trials should be conducted in high-quality patients with a high risk of bias and should be powered to detect clinically important changes in weight loss.

150,the overall analysis shows a benefit in pulmonary outcomes in the group electively ventilated with hfjv. of concern is the significant increase in acute brain injury in one trial which used lower mean airway pressures when ventilating with hfjv. there are as yet no long term pulmonary or neurodevelopmental outcomes from any of the trials.,there is insufficient evidence to support the use of hfjv in the treatment of preterm infants with uncomplicated rds., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of high-frequency jet ventilation in preterm infants with respiratory distress syndrome. there is a need for further well-designed controlled trials to determine the optimal mode of ventilation for these infants. such trials should be conducted in prelabilated infants with rds. such studies should include long-term follow-up to assess the effect of high frequency jet ventilation on important outcomes such as neuroimaging and neurodevelopmental outcomes.
151,acupuncture appeared to be safe but without clear evidence of benefit. the number of patients is too small to be certain whether acupuncture is effective for treatment of acute ischaemic or haemorrhagic stroke. larger methodologically-sound trials are required.,there is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to support the use of acupuncture in the treatment of stroke., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of acupuncture for the treatment of acute stroke patients with hemiparesis of the left or right side. however there is some evidence that acupuncture may be effective in improving functional outcome and improving quality of life in acute stroke. there is no evidence to suggest that acupuncture is effective for other types of functional impairment or that it may be beneficial for other forms of treatment such as physiotherapy and occupational therapy.
152,there is no certain study regarding appropriate use dose and length of therapy for acute gvhd. further studies are needed to define the appropriate use of steroids and whether other agents are appropriate as frontline therapy.,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of corticosteroids in the management of gvhd. further randomised controlled trials are needed., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the routine use of corticosteroids for acute gvhd prophylaxis. however there is a need for high quality randomised controlled trials with adequate follow-up to determine the optimal dose and duration of treatment for this condition. such trials should be conducted in patients with advanced stages of acute gvshd who are at high risk of acute graft-related mortality or who are willing to tolerate treatment.

156,the evidence suggests that artemisinin drugs are no worse than quinine in preventing death in severe or complicated malaria. no artemisinin derivative appears to be better than the others. this review summarizes trials up to 1999. for the reasons in the what's new section this review will no longer be updated.,there is insufficient evidence to support the use of artemether in the treatment of severe malaria., artemether and artemisinin are effective in reducing the risk of hypoglycaemia and reducing the duration of coma in people with severe falciparum malaria in ethiopia and in people treated with antimalarial drugs. artemisisinin is more effective than artemisid monocybinine for treating severe and complicated malaria in those treated with quinine and artemsidial quininine for reducing the time to recovery in those with severe malaria in people who are not stable.
157,medication treatments can be effective in paediatric anxiety disorders acting to reduce core symptoms and should be considered as part of the treatment of these disorders. the greatest number of trials showing efficacy to date have assessed the ssris in treating paediatric ocd. there is no clear evidence to show that any particular class of medication is more effective or better tolerated than any other. as quantitative data was only available for the ssris and venlafaxine the routine use of benzodiazepines cannot be recommended especially given concerns of dependency and treatment related emergent adverse events associated with this class of drugs. future rcts could help identify potential clinical moderators of treatment efficacy. studies of the long-term efficacy of medication treatment optimal dosage as well as direct comparisons of pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy are also warranted.,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of antidepressants in children with obsessive-compulsive disorder. further research is needed., there is insufficient evidence to support the use of sertraline for treating anxiety disorders and social phobia in children and adolescents with ocd but no evidence to suggest that the combination is superior to the combination in treating social anxiety disorder and avoidanceant disorders in children. no evidence was found for other types of medications such as antidepressive therapy or for other forms of treatment for ocd or for treating people with overanxious and avoidant disorders.
158,methenamine hippurate may be effective for preventing uti in patients without renal tract abnormalities particularly when used for short-term prophylaxis. it does not appear to work in patients with neuropathic bladder or in patients who have renal tract abnormalities. the rate of adverse events was low but poorly described. there is a need for further large well-conducted rcts to clarify this question particularly for longer term use for people without neuropathic bladder.,there is insufficient evidence to determine whether prophylactic antibiotics are effective in preventing uti in women with neurogenic bladder following surgery., antimicroactic treatment with methenamine hippurate and trimethoprim is effective in preventing bacteriuria in women with neuropathic bladder infection. antimicroicroactic therapy should be used in combination with other antimicroactials. however there is insufficient evidence to support the routine use of antimicrocts in this setting. further trials are required to determine whether antimicroscylactic treatment is effective and to determine the optimal antibiotic regimen for this condition.
159,there is insufficient evidence to assess the effectiveness of interventions for domestic violence on pregnancy outcomes. there is a need for high-quality rcts with adequate statistical power to determine whether intervention programs prevent or reduce domestic violence episodes during pregnancy or have any effect on maternal and neonatal mortality and morbidity outcomes.,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of interventions for women with intimate partner violence. further research is needed., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of nurse-delivered interventions for women at risk for domestic violence in pregnancy. women should be informed of the potential benefits and harms of nursing care for women who are at risk of domestic violence and should be encouraged to take care of their partners. women need to be informed about the potential harms and benefits of nursing services for women with domestic violence.
160,there is some evidence to suggest that ibuprofen dressings may offer pain relief to people with painful venous leg ulcers. emla 5 appears to provide effective pain relief during the debridement of venous leg ulcers. further research should consider standardised pain assessment methods and assess both the effect on ulcer healing and the impact of long term use of these treatments.,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of emla for the treatment of leg ulcers. further research is needed., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of topical anaesthetic preparations for treating ulcers of venous leg ulcers. there is a need for further well-designed and reported trials to determine the efficacy and safety of topical preparations for ulcers associated with debridement. these trials should be conducted in patients with venous ulcer types with a high risk of adverse events and should be of high quality.
161,there was a lower incidence of hit and hit complicated by vte in postoperative patients undergoing thromboprophylaxis with lmwh compared with ufh. this is consistent with the current clinical use of lmwh over ufh as front-line heparin therapy. however conclusions are limited by a scarcity of high quality evidence. we did not expect the paucity of rcts including hit as an outcome as heparin is one of the most commonly used drugs worldwide and hit is a life-threatening adverse drug reaction. to address the scarcity of clinically-relevant information on the topic of hit as a whole hit should be included as an outcome in future rcts of heparin and hit as an adverse drug reaction should be considered in clinical recommendations regarding monitoring of the platelet count for hit.,there is insufficient evidence to support the use of heparin for the prevention of thrombosis in postoperative orthopedic patients., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of unfractionated heparin in orthopedic patients with low-molecular-weight lmolesp. there is a need for further well designed and reported trials to evaluate the effects of unfractated hegarin on clinical outcomes such as mortality and quality of life. such trials should be conducted in the context of adequately powered placebo-controlled trials.
162,oral or intravenous furosemide cannot be recommended as treatment for transient tachypnoea of the newborn and it should not be used unless additional data become available. this finding suggests that either furosemide is not effective in promoting resorption of lung fluid or factors other than delayed resorption of this fluid contribute to the pathogenesis of transient tachypnoea of the newborn. the question remains as to whether furosemide given to the infant or even to the mother before caesarean section might shorten the duration of the illness. as elective caesarean section continues at a high level these two interventions might be worthy of trials.,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of furosemide in the treatment of transient tachypnea of the newborn., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the routine use of intravenous frusemide in the treatment of transient tachypnoea of the newborn. there is a need for well-designed controlled trials to evaluate the efficacy and safety of this intervention in infants with transient tachyypnea. such trials should be conducted in low-income countries and should be of high methodological quality.

167,this review was unable to demonstrate any advantage of ccpt over other airway clearance techniques in terms of respiratory function but this may have reflected insufficient evidence rather than real equivalence between methods. there was a trend for participants to prefer self-administered airway clearance techniques. limitations of this review included a paucity of well-designed adequately-powered long-term trials.,there is insufficient evidence to support the use of manual chest physiotherapy for the treatment of cystic fibrosis., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of chest physiotherapy for cystic fibrosis. there is a need for well-designed randomised controlled trials to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of this intervention. these trials should be conducted in clinical settings. the current evidence is insufficient to make any recommendations for clinical practice. future trials should include adequately powered randomised clinical trials with adequate sample sizes and adequate follow-up periods to assess the effectiveness of the intervention.
168,interventions to improve water quality are generally effective in preventing diarrhoea and interventions to improve water quality at the household level are more effective than those at the source. significant heterogeneity among the trials suggests that the actual level of effectiveness may depend on a variety of conditions that research to date cannot fully explain. rigorous blinded multi-arm randomized controlled trials conducted over a longer duration in a variety if settings may help clarify the potential effectiveness.,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of water chlorination for diarrhoea prevention in rural areas., there is insufficient evidence to support the use of home-based water-based interventions in reducing diarrhoea in hiv-positive people in areas of africa. there is a need for high quality trials to investigate the effectiveness of home water- based interventions in preventing diarrhoeas in areas with low-income countries. there are insufficient data to draw any conclusions about the effects of water/based interventions on diarrhoeal diseases in areas where drinking water is contaminated with faecal coliform coliform disease.

170,quetiapine may not differ from typical antipsychotics in the treatment of positive symptoms and general psychopathology. there are no clear differences in terms of the treatment of negative symptoms. however it causes fewer adverse effects in terms of abnormal ecg extrapyramidal effects abnormal prolactin levels and weight gain.,there is insufficient evidence to support the use of quetiapine or haloperidol for the treatment of schizophrenia. further trials are needed to determine the effectiveness of these drugs., antipsychotics are effective in reducing symptoms in people with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorders. however there is insufficient evidence to support their use as a first-generation antipsychotic for people who are atypical schizophrenia. there is a need for well-designed randomised controlled trials with adequate follow-up to assess the effects of these drugs on people with severe schizophrenia and schizophrenia. future trials should be conducted in order to provide more reliable and methodologically sound estimates of the effect of these agents on mood disorders.
171,intraventricular fibrinolytic therapy with streptokinase given when post-hemorrhagic ventricular dilatation is established cannot be recommended for neonates following ivh. a conservative approach with csf drainage applied only to symptomatic raised intracranial pressure seems appropriate.,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of intraventricular streptokinase in neonates with posthaemorrhagic hydrocephalus., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the routine use of intraventricular streptokinase treatment in preterm infants with post-haemorrhagic hydrocephalus. there is a need for further well-designed and reported trials to evaluate the efficacy and safety of this intervention. such trials should include long-term follow-up of preterm newborns to determine whether the intervention is beneficial or not.
172,based on the findings of three small rcts of moderate to severely poisoned patients glucocorticoid with cyclophosphamide in addition to standard care may be a beneficial treatment for patients with paraquat-induced lung fibrosis. to enable further study of the effects of glucocorticoid with cyclophosphamide for patients with moderate to severe paraquat poisoning hospitals may provide this treatment as part of an rct with allocation concealment.,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of cyclophosphamide in the treatment of paraquat poisoning. further trials are needed to confirm the effectiveness of cyclaphosphamide as an anti-inflammatory agent., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of anti-inflammatory agents in the treatment of paraquat poisoning. however there is a need for further well-designed and reported randomised controlled trials to evaluate the effects of antiinflammatory agents on the prevention of severe acute paraqat poisoning in patients with moderate to severe acute acute pao2-pao2.
173,limited data from small studies using neuroleptic reduction or specific neuroleptic drugs as treatments for td did not provide any convincing evidence of the value of these approaches. there is a need for larger trials of a longer duration in order to fully investigate this area.,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of haloperidol for the treatment of chronic schizophrenia., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of neuroleptic agents for treating tardive dyskinesia in people with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorders. however there is a need for further well-designed and reported trials to evaluate the efficacy and safety of these agents in patients with schizophrenia and schizoective disorders and to compare them to placebo. future research should focus on improving the quality of life of people with established tardsive dyskiinesia and other types of schizophrenia.

175,there is not enough evidence to reliably assess the possible role of homeopathy in asthma. as well as randomised trials there is a need for observational data to document the different methods of homeopathic prescribing and how patients respond. this will help to establish to what extent people respond to a package of care rather than the homeopathic intervention alone.,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of homeopathic remedies for the treatment of asthma in children., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of homeopathic remedies for asthma in children with mild to moderate asthma. there is a need for well-designed adequately powered randomized controlled trials to evaluate the efficacy and safety of these interventions in asthma. such trials should be conducted in high-income countries with low risk of bias and should be powered to detect clinically important adverse effects such as adverse effects.
176,the results suggest that iodised salt is an effective means of improving iodine status. no conclusions can be made about improvements in other more patient-oriented outcomes such as physical and mental development in children and mortality. none of the studies specifically investigated development of iodine-induced hyperthyroidism which can be easily overlooked if just assessed on the basis of symptoms. high quality controlled studies investigating relevant long term outcome measures are needed to address questions of dosage and best means of iodine supplementation in different population groups and settings.,there is insufficient evidence to support the use of iodinated salt for the treatment of iodine deficiency in children., iodine interventions are effective in reducing iodine deficiency in iodine-deficient children with iodine deficiency </interventions> iodine interventions may be effective in iodine deficiency but the evidence is not strong enough to support the routine use of iodine interventions in iodine deficient children. further research is required to determine the optimal dose and duration of treatment and to assess the effects of iodine supplementation on iodine deficiency and iodine deficiency.
177,the authors found three randomised controlled trials albeit of moderate to poor quality that suggest a short-term benefit of oral steroids in patients with multiple nasal polyps. to address the issue more thoroughly well-designed prospective randomised controlled trials are still needed.,there is insufficient evidence to support the use of corticosteroids in the treatment of nasal polyposis., oral corticosteroids are effective in treating sinonasal polyps and doxycycline is effective in relieving ecp and ecp. however there is insufficient evidence to support their use in the treatment of nasal polyps. there is a need for well-designed adequately powered placebo-controlled trials with adequate follow-up to assess the effects on ecp symptoms and to compare the effects of oral steroids with placebo in the management of ecp with placebo.
178,the evidence derived from these limited studies suggests that 2000 mcg doses of oral vitamin b12 daily and 1000 mcg doses initially daily and thereafter weekly and then monthly may be as effective as intramuscular administration in obtaining short term haematological and neurological responses in vitamin b12 deficient patients.,there is insufficient evidence to support the use of oral cobalamin for the treatment of peripheral neuropathy. further trials are needed., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of oral cobalamin treatment for folate deficiency p.o. in the treatment of megaloblastic anemia there is a need for well-designed adequately powered randomised controlled trials with adequate follow-up. such trials should be conducted in the context of adequate placebo-controlled clinical trials.
179,naltrexone appears to be an effective and safe strategy in alcoholism treatment. even though the sizes of treatment effects might appear moderate in their magnitudes these should be valued against the background of the relapsing nature of alcoholism and the limited therapeutic options currently available for its treatment.,there is insufficient evidence to support the use of naltrexone for the treatment of alcohol dependence in alcohol dependent patients., naltrexone is effective in reducing the number of people who relapse to alcohol and comorbid alcohol-related problems and reducing the rate of craving during the first period of treatment. no reduction in craving or craving was reported in the included studies. no decrease in craving was observed in the studies included in the meta-analysis but no reduction was found in the control groups. no reductions in craving and craving were reported in any of the included trials.
180,there are no data from placebo controlled trials regarding the efficacy of naftopidil in men with symptomatic bph. limited information suggests that treatment with naftopidil provides short-term improvement in urinary symptom-scale scores total ipss/aua qol quality of life score and urinary symptoms from baseline comparable to low-dose tamsulosin. adverse effects due to naftopidil were few and usually mild.,the is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of naftopidil in the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of anticholinergic agents for the treatment of bph in patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia bph. there is a need for further well-designed controlled trials to investigate the effectiveness of monotherapy for bph patients with lower urinary tract symptoms associated with bph as well as to assess the safety and efficacy of other types of monotherapies such as tamsulosin hydrochloride monotherapy and tamsulinosin monotherapy.
181,although acute bacterial conjunctivitis is frequently self limiting the findings from this updated systematic review suggest that the use of antibiotic eye drops is associated with modestly improved rates of clinical and microbiological remission in comparison to the use of placebo. use of antibiotic eye drops should therefore be considered in order to speed the resolution of symptoms and infection.,there is insufficient evidence to support the use of ophthalmic suspension for the treatment of bacterial conjunctivitis in children., moxifloxacin ophthalmic suspension is effective for bacterial conjunctivitis in people with acute bacterial infections. there is insufficient evidence to support the use of topical antibiotics for bacterial eradication in patients with acute bacteria. there are insufficient data to determine whether topical antibiotics are more effective than topical antibiotics in reducing bacterial infections in people who are not treated with topical antibiotics.
182,this review provides evidence that prt is an effective intervention for improving physical functioning in older people including improving strength and the performance of some simple and complex activities. however some caution is needed with transferring these exercises for use with clinical populations because adverse events are not adequately reported.,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of resistance training in people with osteoarthritis of the knee., there is insufficient evidence to support the use of progressive resistance training for people with chf and other types of physical diseases. these studies are insufficient to support current recommendations for the development of long-term aerobic resistance training in older people due to the lack of evidence in this area.<interventions for women with chp and other forms of physical therapies are required to improve the quality of life and reduce the risk of falls.
183,there is no reliable evidence from randomised controlled trials to support the effectiveness of haemostatic drugs in reducing mortality or disability in patients with tbi. new randomised controlled trials assessing the effects of haemostatic drugs in tbi patients should be conducted. these trials should be large enough to detect clinically plausible treatment effects.,there is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to support the use of ct scans in the treatment of traumatic brain injury., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of thromboembolic agents in the treatment of acute polytrauma. further well-designed and reported trials are needed to confirm the effectiveness of these agents in treating acute traumatic brain injury. such trials should include adequately powered placebo-controlled trials with adequate follow-up to assess the effect of throembolic agent on outcomes such as death and adverse events.

186,in children over the age of two years with acute asthma exacerbations inhaled anticholinergics as single agent bronchodilators were less efficacious than beta2-agonists. inhaled anticholinergics were also less efficacious than inhaled anticholinergics combined with beta2-agonists. inhaled anticholinergic drugs alone are not appropriate for use as a single agent in children with acute asthma exacerbations.,the is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of ipratropium or fenoterol in the treatment of acute asthma., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of inhaled ipratropium/fenoterol for acute asthma in children with mild bronchoconstriction. there is a need for more high quality controlled trials to evaluate the efficacy and safety of this intervention in adults with acute asthma. such trials should be conducted with adequate follow-up to determine the optimal dose and route of administration and duration of administration.
187,oral protein calorie supplements are widely used to improve the nutritional status of children with a number of chronic diseases. we identified a small number of studies assessing these products in children with cystic fibrosis but were unable to draw any conclusions based on the limited data extracted. we recommend a series of large randomised controlled trials be undertaken investigating the use of these products in children with different chronic diseases. until further data are available we suggest these products are used with caution.,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of oral protein energy supplements in children with cystic fibrosis., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of dietary supplements in cystic fibrosis. there is a need for well-designed adequately powered controlled trials to evaluate the effects of dietary interventions on nutritional status in children with cf. the results of these trials should be interpreted with caution as they are based on only a small number of small studies with low risk of bias.
188,there was no evidence available from randomised controlled trials to assess the effectiveness of hypnosis during pregnancy childbirth and the postnatal period for preventing postnatal depression. evidence from randomised controlled trials is needed to evaluate the use and effects of hypnosis during the perinatal period to prevent postnatal depression. two trials are currently underway which may provide further information in the future.,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of hypnotic analgesia in childbirth education. further research is needed to determine the effectiveness and safety of hypnosis for women with depression., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of hypnotic induction for the treatment of women with pre-existing premenstrual conditions. there is a need for high quality randomised controlled trials to evaluate the effectiveness of hypnotics induction for women with post-menstruals. such trials should be conducted in low-resource settings.

191,although antibiotic treatment is effective for the cure of urinary tract infections there are insufficient data to recommend any specific drug regimen for treatment of symptomatic urinary tract infections during pregnancy. all the antibiotics studied were shown to be very effective in decreasing the incidence of the different outcomes. complications were very rare. all included trials had very small sample sizes to reliably detect important differences between treatments. future studies should evaluate the most promising antibiotics in terms of class timing dose acceptability maternal and neonatal outcomes and costs.,there is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of oral antibiotics in the treatment of acute pyelonephritis., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of oral antibiotics for the treatment of pyelonephritis during pregnancy. there is a need for well-designed randomised controlled trials with adequate follow-up to determine the optimal antibiotic regimen for this condition. there are insufficient data to support the routine use of antibiotics for treating acute pyelonesones in pregnancy. further trials are needed to assess the effectiveness and safety of antibiotic therapy for women with acute uti during pregnancy and to compare the effectiveness of different antibiotic regimens.
192,no results are conclusive and all are based on small short studies. it would be understandable however if clinicians were cautious in prescribing doses in excess of 7.5 mg/day of haloperidol to a person with uncomplicated acute schizophrenia and if people with schizophrenia were equally reticent to take greater doses. further research is needed regarding the efficacy and tolerability of the 1.5-3.0 mg/day dose range.,therehaloperidol appears to be an effective treatment for schizophrenia. however there is insufficient evidence to determine whether it is superior to placebo or placebo., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of haloperidol as a treatment for schizoaffective disorders. there is a need for further high quality randomised controlled trials to confirm the effectiveness of halopidol in schizoective disorders and to evaluate its safety and tolerability in people with schizophrenia. future research should focus on improving the quality of life and on the development of long-term neuroleptic treatment.
193,there is some evidence that adding on services or linkages may improve the utilisation and outputs of healthcare delivery. however there is no evidence to date that a fuller form of integration improves healthcare delivery or health status. available evidence suggests that full integration probably decreases the knowledge and utilisation of specific services and may not result in any improvements in health status. more rigorous studies of different strategies to promote integration over a wider range of services and settings are needed. these studies should include economic evaluation and the views of clients as clients views will influence the uptake of integration strategies at the point of delivery and the effectiveness on community health of these strategies.,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of community-based hiv counselling for women with hiv. further research is needed to determine the effectiveness of community based hiv counselling., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of hiv testing and counseling for hiv prevention in low-resource settings in africa. there is a need for high quality trials to investigate the effectiveness of hivo testing and counselling in hiv-positive women with hiv infection. such trials should be conducted in settings with low prevalence and low risk of bias and should be undertaken in areas where hiv prevalence is high.
194,limited evidence suggests that the method of antibiotic administration oral versus parenteral does not affect the rate of disease remission if the bacteria are sensitive to the antibiotic used. however this and the lack of statistically significant differences in adverse effects need confirmation. no or insufficient evidence exists for other aspects of antibiotic therapy for chronic osteomyelitis.,there is insufficient evidence to support the use of oral antibiotics for the treatment of osteomyelitis in adults., oral ciprofloxacin monotherapy is as effective as oral parenteral antibiotics for the treatment of osteomyelitis in susceptible organisms. there is insufficient evidence to support the routine use of oral antibiotics for osmylococcal and bacterial infections in people with chronic osmicrobials. the current evidence is insufficient to support routine treatment with oral antibiotics in adults.
195,the evidence suggests that a discharge plan tailored to the individual patient probably brings about reductions in hospital length of stay and readmission rates for older people admitted to hospital with a medical condition. the impact of discharge planning on mortality health outcomes and cost remains uncertain.,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of hospital-based discharge planning for patients with congestive heart failure. further research is needed., early discharge planning is effective in reducing readmission and reducing hospitalisations in patients with congestive heart failure and reducing the rate of hospitalisations for falling and death </interventions> these benefits are likely to be sustained in patients who are at high risk for falling. these benefits should be maintained in patients at low risk of falling and reduced hospitalisations. the effect of early discharge plans on mortality and reduced readmission rates for patients with end-organ damage and reduced rates of hospital stay.
196,intensive interventions unsuited to primary care or population prevention programmes provide only minimal reductions in blood pressure during long-term trials. further evaluations to assess effects on morbidity and mortality outcomes are needed for populations as a whole and for patients with elevated blood pressure. a low sodium diet may help in maintenance of lower blood pressure following withdrawal of antihypertensives. if this is confirmed with no increase in cardiovascular events then targeting of comprehensive dietary and behavioural programmes in patients with elevated blood pressure requiring drug treatment would be justified.,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of sodium restriction in people with hypertension. there is no evidence that sodium restriction reduces blood pressure or blood pressure., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of dietary interventions to reduce blood pressure in people with elevated blood pressure. there is a need for further well-designed controlled trials to determine the effects of sodium reduction on blood pressure and blood pressure lowering in hypertensive patients with normal blood pressure levels. these trials should be conducted in high-normal blood pressure groups with low-normal levels.
197,the trials offer little useful data to the clinician hoping to treat psychosis-related polydipsia with drugs except that further evaluative studies need to be conducted in this area. treatment of any sort for psychosis related polydipsia might only be informative within a well designed conducted and reported randomised study. the two pioneering studies suggest that larger trials though difficult would not be impossible with adequate support and co-ordination.,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of naloxone in the treatment of pip syndrome., naloxone and naltrexone may be effective in treating acute hyponatremia and polydipsia. however there is insufficient evidence to make any recommendations about the use of these drugs in this condition. further research is needed to determine the optimal opioid treatment for acute hyponsia and other types of opioid treatment in this population. the results of this review should be interpreted with caution as they are based on a small number of studies with relatively low risk of bias.

201,most chinese medical herbs in the included studies showed similar effects to antiviral drugs in preventing or treating influenza. few were shown to be superior to antiviral drugs. no obvious adverse events were reported in the included studies. however current evidence remains weak due to methodological limitations of the trials. more high-quality rcts with larger numbers of participants and clear reporting are needed.,there is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to support the use of herbs for the prevention and management of influenza., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the routine use of chinese herbs for the treatment of influenza-like symptoms. further trials are needed to confirm the effectiveness of these herbal herbs in preventing acute influenza and to determine whether they are effective in reducing the severity of acute influenza symptoms in people with confirmed influenza. these trials should be conducted in high-income countries with low-income populations.
202,the studies included in this review do not allow firm conclusions as to the question of whether the quality of life of people after anterior resection is superior to that of people after abdominoperineal excision/hartmann's operation. the included studies challenges the assumption that anterior resection patients fare better.larger better designed and executed prospective studies are needed to answer this question.,there is insufficient evidence to support the use of surgery for rectal cancer. further randomised controlled trials are needed to assess the effect of surgery on quality of life., there is insufficient evidence to support the use of anterior resection for colorectal cancer as anastomosis for rectal cancer </interventions> there is no evidence to suggest that anterior resections for colotal cancer is associated with better quality of life in patients with rectal cancers. there is also evidence that the treatment of patients with low rectal tumal cancers following ap is associated to reduce the risk of constal cancer in patients who are at increased risk of post-operative gastrointestinal problems and a decreased risk for constal cancers in patients at higher risk of gastrointestinal complications.
203,there is insufficient evidence to claim or refute a benefit for any antifungal agent in treating candidiasis. further well designed placebo-controlled trials assessing the effectiveness of old and new interventions for treating oral candidiasis are needed. clinicians need to make a decision on whether to prevent or treat oral candidiasis in patients receiving treatment for cancer.,the is insufficient evidence to support the use of oral corticosteroids in the treatment of cancer., there is insufficient evidence to support the use of topical antifungal agents for oropharyngeal candidiasis in cancer patients. however there is a need for further trials to determine the optimal treatment for this condition. these trials should be conducted in patients with head and neck tumours and should be adequately powered to detect clinically important differences in efficacy and safety between different types of topical agents.
204,carbamazepine is effective in chronic neuropathic pain with caveats. no trial was longer than four weeks of good reporting quality using outcomes equivalent to at least moderate clinical benefit. in these circumstances caution is needed in interpretation and meaningful comparison with other interventions is not possible.,there is insufficient evidence to recommend carbamazepine as an effective treatment for pain relief in patients with severe dpn., there is insufficient evidence to support the use of corticosteroids for the treatment of cpspp but there is some evidence that they may be effective in treating trigeminal neuralgia. there is no evidence to suggest that they are not effective for cpspsp. however there is a need for further well-designed controlled trials with adequate power to detect clinically important differences in efficacy and safety.
205,calcium antagonists reduce the risk of poor outcome and secondary ischaemia after aneurysmal sah. the results for poor outcome depend largely on a single large trial of oral nimodipine the evidence for other calcium antagonists is inconclusive. the evidence for nimodipine is not beyond all doubt but given the potential benefits and modest risks of this treatment oral nimodipine is currently indicated in patients with aneurysmal sah. intravenous administration of calcium antagonists cannot be recommended for routine practice on the basis of the present evidence. magnesium sulphate is a promising agent but more evidence is needed before definite conclusions can be drawn.,there is no evidence to support or refute the use of nimodipine in the treatment of subarachnoid haemorrhage. there is a need for further research., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of calcium channel blockers for the treatment of subarachnoid haemorrhage. however there is no evidence to suggest that calcium channel blocker is effective in reducing the risk of cerebral aneurysmal stroke or stroke in patients with dci. further trials are required to determine the optimal dose and duration of vasospasm and to assess the effects on stroke and stroke.
206,to date there is no evidence of effective treatment in preventing malignant transformation of leukoplakia. treatments may be effective in the resolution of lesion however relapses and adverse effects are common.,there is insufficient evidence to support the use of oral leukoplakia as a treatment for dysplasia in patients with oral leukeoplakia., oral leukoplakia with oral vitamin a is associated with a significant reduction in the number of oral lesions and a decreased risk of dysplasia. however there is insufficient evidence to support the routine use of oral leukeoplakia as an oral treatment for oral leukaoplakia. further trials are required to determine the optimal route of administration and to assess the optimal dose and duration of treatment for this disease.
207,collaborative care is associated with significant improvement in depression and anxiety outcomes compared with usual care and represents a useful addition to clinical pathways for adult patients with depression and anxiety.,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of telemedicine for depression in primary care settings., punchline_effect strategies are effective in reducing depressive symptoms and improving functional status in primary care patients and reducing depression severity. these benefits are associated with increased rates of antidepressant treatment and increased frequency of visits for depression patients and decreased rates of depression-specific visits for primary care visits. more studies are needed to evaluate the effects of punchlines on depression severity and to assess depression severity for depression and reduce the number of depressive episodes and decrease rates of depressive-specific episodes.
208,this review of randomised controlled trials showed that vigabatrin can reduce seizure frequency in people with drug-resistant partial epilepsy. short-term follow-up of patients showed that some side effects were associated with its use. further analysis of longer-term observational studies is required to evaluate how likely patients are to develop visual field defects and whether such side effects are associated with dose and duration of drug use.,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of vigabatrin for the treatment of refractory partial seizures., vigabatrin is an effective antiepileptic drug for the control of partial seizures in people with refractory epilepsy. no adverse events were reported in patients with moderate to severe epilepsy but no serious adverse effects were reported. no serious neurological adverse events occurred in patients treated with vigabatinrin. the evidence is insufficient to draw any conclusions about the efficacy of vigababatr for treating partial seizures. the available data are insufficient to make any recommendations for clinical practice.
209,the outcomes reported severely limit conclusions for clinical practice. we found little robust evidence that sterile water is effective for low back or any other labour pain. neither did we find any difference in delivery or other maternal or fetal outcomes. further large methodologically rigorous studies are required to determine the efficacy of sterile water to relieve pain in labour.,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of sterile water for labour pain relief in women with low back pain., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of sterile water for the treatment of low-back pain in labour. there is a need for well designed trials to evaluate the effectiveness of this intervention for women with low-bp. women with subcutaneous injections for low-p.2 pain relief in labour and women with lower-back conditions.
210,early intervention programmes for preterm infants have a positive influence on cognitive and motor outcomes during infancy with the cognitive benefits persisting into pre-school age. there is a great deal of heterogeneity between studies due to the variety of early developmental intervention programmes trialled and gestational ages of the preterm infants included which limits the comparisons of intervention programmes. further research is needed to determine which early developmental interventions are the most effective at improving cognitive and motor outcomes and on the longer-term effects of these programmes.,the is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of early intervention for preterm infants. further research is needed to assess the effects of early interventions on developmental outcomes in preterm babies., early intervention programs for preterm infants are effective in reducing the risk of cp and reducing the rate of cerebral palsy and neurodevelopmental abnormalities. these benefits are likely to be sustained in the first six months of life. however there is insufficient evidence to support the use of early intervention programmes for early preterm children. there is a need for further trials to evaluate the effects of early interventions for early childhood preterm and to determine whether early intervention is beneficial for early developmental outcomes.
211,there is no reliable evidence from the trials included in this review that any specific initial arch wire material is better or worse than another with regard to speed of alignment or pain. there is no evidence at all about the effect of initial arch wire materials on the important adverse effect of root resorption. further well-designed and conducted adequately-powered rcts are required to determine whether the performance of initial arch wire materials as demonstrated in the laboratory makes a clinically important difference to the alignment of teeth in the initial stage of orthodontic treatment in patients.,there is insufficient evidence to support the use of arch wires in the treatment of dental arches. there is a need for further randomised controlled trials., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of any of the following interventions for orthodontic dentitions. there is a need for well-designed adequately powered randomised controlled trials to evaluate the effectiveness of these interventions in the management of crowded dentitions and to compare the effectiveness and safety of different types of interventions for this purpose. future trials should focus on improving the quality of life of patients and on improving dental outcomes.
212,there is evidence to favour scs over standard conservative treatment alone to improve limb salvage and clinical situations in patients with nr-ccli. the benefits of scs must be considered against the possible harm of relatively mild complications and the costs.,there is insufficient evidence to support the use of scs in the treatment of non-reconstructible leg ischaemia., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of spinal cord stimulation for nonhealing foot ulcers or dry gangrene. however there is a need for further well-designed and reported trials to assess the effects of spinal- cord stimulation on nonheal ulcers and/or dry gangrenes. these trials should be conducted in low-reconstructible patients with non-healing ulcers.
213,there is currently no evidence from randomised trials to support routine use of physical or pharmacological strategies to reduce temperature in patients with acute stroke. large randomised clinical trials are needed to study the effect of such strategies.,there is no evidence to support the use of hypothermia in patients with acute ischemic stroke., hypothermia is a common complication in acute ischemic stroke. there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of any of the interventions in acute hypotherapymia. further trials are required to confirm the efficacy and safety of these interventions in patients with ischemia and to determine whether they should be used in this patient population as they are likely to be more effective than placebo.
214,the conclusion is that the choice of drug must be made based on consideration of drug-specific side effect properties.,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of imipramine in the treatment of dysthymia., moclobemide and imipramine are more effective than placebo for the treatment of depression dysthymic disorders. however there is insufficient evidence to recommend their use as an adjunctive treatment for depression. further research is required to determine the optimal dose and duration of treatment and to compare the efficacy and safety of sertraline with other antidepressants.
215,cytisine increases the chances of quitting although absolute quit rates were modest in two recent trials. varenicline at standard dose increased the chances of successful long-term smoking cessation between two and threefold compared with pharmacologically unassisted quit attempts. lower dose regimens also conferred benefits for cessation while reducing the incidence of adverse events. more participants quit successfully with varenicline than with bupropion. two open-label trials of varenicline versus nrt suggested a modest benefit of varenicline but confidence intervals did not rule out equivalence. limited evidence suggests that varenicline may have a role to play in relapse prevention. the main adverse effect of varenicline is nausea but mostly at mild to moderate levels and tending to subside over time. possible links with serious adverse events including serious psychiatric or cardiovascular events cannot be ruled out. future trials of cytisine may test extended regimens and more intensive behavioural support. there is a need for further trials of the efficacy of varenicline treatment extended beyond 12 weeks.,there is insufficient evidence to support the use of varenicline for smoking cessation in smokers with moderate to moderate smoking status., varenicline is effective for reducing the proportion of smokers who quit after 12-month with no reduction in all-cause mortality and a decreased risk of cardiovascular events but a decreased chance of smoking-associated events. a decreased likelihood of stopping after 12 months is associated with a decreased rate of smoking cessation. a decrease in all causes of death is not associated with increased risk of serious adverse events and a decrease of smoking associated cardiovascular events.
216,currently there is no evidence to suggest a protective effect of ischaemic preconditioning in non-cirrhotic patients undergoing liver resection under continuous vascular occlusion. ischaemic preconditioning reduces the blood transfusion requirements in patients undergoing liver resection.,the ischemic preconditioning is effective in preventing hepatic resection under vascular exclusion of the liver. however there is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of this technique for the prevention of liver disease., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of any of the interventions reviewed in this review. however there is a need for further well-designed and reported trials to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of interventions for liver resections. such trials should be conducted in patients with high risk of complications such as infection and nec and should be powered to detect clinically important differences in outcomes.
217,the results of this review show that airway clearance techniques have short-term effects in the terms of increasing mucus transport. no evidence was found on which to draw conclusions concerning the long-term effects.,the is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of chest physiotherapy for the treatment of cystic fibrosis., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of chest physiotherapy regimens for cystic fibrosis. there is a need for further well-designed and reported trials to evaluate the effectiveness of chest- physiotherapy and to compare these regimens with other types of physiotherapy. these trials should include adequately powered placebo-controlled trials with adequate follow-up.
218,ice massage compared to control had a statistically beneficial effect on rom function and knee strength. cold packs decreased swelling. hot packs had no beneficial effect on edema compared with placebo or cold application. ice packs did not affect pain significantly compared to control in patients with oa. more well designed studies with a standardized protocol and adequate number of participants are needed to evaluate the effects of thermotherapy in the treatment of oa of the knee.,there is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of local heat or cold therapy in the rehabilitation of knee arthroplasty patients., there is insufficient evidence to support the use of local heat or cold therapy for the treatment of knee arthroplasty in people with osteoarthritis of the knee. there is a need for further well-designed and reported trials to evaluate the effectiveness of these interventions in the management of pain in people who are ooarthritic. the results of this review suggest that local heat and cold therapy may be effective in reducing pain and improving function in patients who are at high risk of rest and are associated with adverse effects.
219,compared with the contrast-assisted cannulation technique the guidewire-assisted cannulation technique increases the primary cannulation rate and reduces the risk of pep and it appears to be the most appropriate first-line cannulation technique.,there is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of a guide wire cannulation technique for the prevention of pancreatic dysfunction in patients with pancreatitis., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of wire-guided cannulation for ercp in patients with acute pancreatitis or acute pancreatic obstructiase deficiency. there is a need for further high quality randomised controlled trials to evaluate the effectiveness of this technique in ercp. future trials should focus on patient-centred outcomes such as pep pep and pep.
220,intramuscular methotrexate at a dose of 15 mg/week is safe and effective for maintenance of remission in crohn's disease. oral methotrexate 12.5 to 15 mg/week does not appear to be effective for maintenance of remission in crohn's disease.,there is insufficient evidence to support the use of 6-mercaptopurine in the treatment of crohn's disease. further trials are needed to confirm the effectiveness of the drug in the management of inflammatory bowel disease., there is insufficient evidence to support the use of methotrexate or 6-mercaptopurine for induction of remission in active crohn's disease. there is a need for well-designed adequately powered randomised controlled trials with adequate follow-up to determine the optimal dose and duration of remission and to compare the efficacy and safety of these agents with placebo.
221,no recommendations can be drawn from the two studies. one study showed a reduction in pe rates but not mortality but was subject to significant biases. the prepic study lacked statistical power to detect a reduction in pe over shorter and more clinically significant time periods. however the trial demonstrated that permanent vcfs were associated with an increased risk of long term lower limb dvt. there is a paucity of vcfs outcome evidence when used within currently approved indications and a lack of trials on retrievable filters. further trials are needed to assess vena caval filter safety and effectiveness.,there is insufficient evidence to support the use of vena cava filters in the treatment of pulmonary embolism., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of vena cava filters for the prevention of pulmonary embolism in people with proximal deep-vein thrombosis. further trials are needed to confirm the effectiveness of these interventions for the treatment of acute pulmonary embolicism in this population. these trials should be powered on the basis of the results of a randomized controlled trial.
222,the results indicate that exercise has positive short-term effects on self-esteem in children and young people. since there are no known negative effects of exercise and many positive effects on physical health exercise may be an important measure in improving children's self-esteem. these conclusions are based on several small low-quality trials.,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of aerobic exercise for children with learning disabilities. further research is needed to determine whether aerobic exercise improves self-concept and self-esteem., aerobic exercise is an effective physical activity intervention for improving physical fitness in pre-adolescent and adolescent males. aerobic exercise appears to be safe and effective in improving physical capacity and improving motor fitness in these populations. the results of this review do not support the routine use of aerobic exercise as an exercise intervention for pre pre-Adolescent or adolescent males with learning disabilities. further research is required to determine whether aerobic exercise can be effective in preventing motor impairments and improve physical fitness.
223,there is evidence for significant beneficial effects of regular exercise on physical fitness walking capacity cardiovascular dimensions e.g. blood pressure and heart rate health-related quality of life and some nutritional parameters in adults with ckd. other outcomes had insufficient evidence due to the lack of data from rcts. the design of the exercise intervention causes difference in effect size and should be considered when prescribing exercise with the aim of affecting a certain outcome. future rcts should focus more on the effects of resistance training interventions or mixed cardiovascular and resistance training as these exercise types have not been studied as much as cardiovascular exercise.,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of exercise training in patients with renal disease., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of exercise for people with end-stage uremic haemodialysis in ssep and erythropoietin in patients with ckd. there is no evidence that aerobic training is associated with increased blood pressure or decreased cardiovascular risk in people with esrd. there are insufficient data to support a reduction in blood pressure and uremic sedentary people with decreased blood pressure in svi in patients who are at increased risk of arrhythmias and decreased cardiovascular status in patients receiving hemodialysis with no evidence of an increased risk profile in those who are unable to tolerate intensive care.
224,augmentation therapy with alpha-1 antitrypsin cannot be recommended in view of the lack of evidence of clinical benefit and the cost of treatment.,there is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to determine whether antitrypsin augmentation therapy improves lung function or exacerbates emphysema., augmentation therapy appears to be effective in treating alpha(1)-antitrypsin deficiency of pi. however there is insufficient evidence to recommend its use as an adjunctive treatment for pi. further well-designed and reported trials are needed to confirm the efficacy and safety of augmentation therapies in patients with pi. these trials should be powered to detect clinically important differences in adverse effects such as fev(1).
225,stepwise and partial excavation reduced the incidence of pulp exposure in symptomless vital carious primary as well as permanent teeth. therefore these techniques show clinical advantage over complete caries removal in the management of dentinal caries. there was no evidence of a difference in signs or symptoms of pulpal disease between stepwise excavation and complete caries removal and insufficient evidence to determine whether or not there was a difference in signs and symptoms of pulp disease between partial caries removal and complete caries removal. when partial caries removal was carried out there was also insufficient evidence to determine whether or not there is a difference in risk of restoration failure. the no dentinal caries removal studies investigating permanent teeth had a similar result with no difference in restoration failure. the other no dentinal caries removal study which investigated primary teeth showed a statistically significant difference in restoration failure favouring the intervention. due to the short term follow-up in most of the included studies and the high risk of bias further high quality long term clinical trials are still required to assess the most effective intervention. however it should be noted that in studies of this nature complete elimination of risk of bias may not necessarily be possible. future research should also investigate patient centred outcomes.,the is insufficient evidence to support the use of partial dentin in primary molars. further research is needed to determine the optimal method of dentin removal for the prevention and management of carious lesions., <interventions> there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of pulp-containing materials in the treatment of permanent pulpitis in adults. there is a need for further well-designed and reported trials to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of these materials in preventing pulp exposure in adults with acute carious lesions in adults and children with acute pulpitis.
226,we cannot make any definite statements on the efficacy and clinical usefulness of electrotherapy modalities for neck pain. since the quality of evidence is low or very low we are uncertain about the estimate of the effect. further research is very likely to change both the estimate of effect and our confidence in the results. current evidence for pemf rms and tens shows that these modalities might be more effective than placebo but not other interventions. funding bias should be considered especially in pemf studies. galvanic current iontophoresis electric muscle stimulation(ems and static magnetic field did not reduce pain or disability. future trials on these interventions should have larger patient samples and include more precise standardization and description of all treatment characteristics.,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of magnetic stimulation for the treatment of neck pain in patients with neck pain., there is insufficient evidence to support the use of electromagnetic therapy for neck pain in adults with whiplash syndrome. there is a need for well-designed controlled trials to investigate the effectiveness of magnetic therapy for cervical pain in women with neck pain. the current evidence is insufficient to support its use in the treatment of neck pain with or without heat and mobilization.
227,there is an absence of evidence as to whether clioquinol pbt1 has any positive clinical benefit for patients with ad or whether the drug is safe. we have some concerns about the quality of the study methodology there was an imbalance in treatment and control groups after randomisation participants in the active treatment group had a higher mean pre-morbid iq and the secondary analyses of results stratified by baseline dementia severity. the planned phase iii trial of pbt1 has been abandoned and this compound has been withdrawn from development. the second trial of pbt2 was more rigorously conducted and showed that after 12 weeks this compound appeared to be safe and well tolerated in people with mild alzheimer's dementia. larger trials are now required to demonstrate cognitive efficacy.,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of clioquinol for the treatment of alzheimer's disease., there is currently insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of anticholinergics in the treatment of alzheimer's disease. however there is a need for further well-designed and reported trials to evaluate the efficacy and safety profile of these agents in the management of this condition. such trials should be conducted in low-income countries with low risk of bias and should be of high quality.
228,prenatal trh in addition to corticosteroids given to women at risk of very preterm birth do not improve infant outcomes and can cause maternal side-effects.,there is insufficient evidence to support the use of corticosteroids for preterm delivery. further trials are needed to determine the optimal dose and duration of the treatment. further research is needed., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of corticosteroids to reduce the risk of neonatal death or chronic lung disease in women at risk of preterm birth. there is a need for further trials to evaluate the effects on neonatal outcomes and to compare the effects of these treatments with other treatments such as oxytocropin-releasing hormone and steroid-based preparations.
229,although it appears that no one procedure produces greater benefit in terms of pain and physical function there was insufficient evidence to be conclusive. trapeziectomy has fewer complications than trapeziectomy with lrti.,there is insufficient evidence to support the use of ligament reconstruction in the treatment of osteoarthritis of the thumb., there is currently insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of any of the following interventions for osteoarthritis of the trapeziometacarpal joint. there is a need for further well-designed and reported trials to evaluate the effectiveness of these interventions in the management of osteo-arthritis. these trials should be powered to detect clinically important differences in pain relief and other adverse effects. such trials should include adequately powered placebo-controlled trials with adequate follow-up.
230,providing additional placental blood to the preterm baby by either delaying cord clamping for 30 to 120 seconds rather than early clamping seems to be associated with less need for transfusion better circulatory stability less intraventricular haemorrhage all grades and lower risk for necrotising enterocolitis. however there were insufficient data for reliable conclusions about the comparative effects on any of the primary outcomes for this review.,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of delayed cord clamping for preterm infants. further trials are needed to determine the optimal timing of clamping., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of delayed cord clamping in preterm infants. there are insufficient data to support the routine use of umbilical cord clampsing to reduce the need for red cell transfusion. further trials are required to determine the optimal timing and duration of clamping to assess the effects of this intervention on neonatal outcomes.
231,despite reviewing 39 eligible trials few firm conclusions could be reached because of the multiple comparisons considered the small size of individual trials and their low quality. whether or not to use a particular policy is usually a trade-off between the risks of morbidity especially infection and risks of recatheterisation.,there is insufficient evidence to support the use of transurethral catheterisation for urinary tract infection after surgery., urethral catheters are associated with a lower rate of urinary tract infection after catheter removal and a higher rate of bacteriuria after bladder empt. however there is insufficient evidence to support the use of bladder drainage after bladder drainage for bladder emptying after bladder resections for bladder obstruction after bladder preparation. there is no evidence that bladder drainage is associated with lower urinary tract infections and a decreased rate of postoperative urinary retention after bladder infusion after bladder drains for bladder preparation for bladder drainage.
232,oseltamivir and zanamivir appear to have modest benefit in reducing duration of illness in children with influenza. however our analysis was limited by small sample sizes and an inability to pool data from different studies. in addition the inclusion of data from published trials only may have resulted in significant publication bias. based on published trial data oseltamivir reduces the incidence of acute otitis media in children aged one to five years but is associated with a significantly increased risk of vomiting. one study demonstrated that laninamivir octanoate was more effective than oseltamivir in shortening duration of illness in children with oseltamivir-resistant influenza a/h1n1. the benefit of oseltamivir and zanamivir in preventing the transmission of influenza in households is modest and based on weak evidence. however the clinical efficacy of neuraminidase inhibitors in at risk children is still uncertain. larger high-quality trials are needed with sufficient power to determine the efficacy of neuraminidase inhibitors in preventing serious complications of influenza such as pneumonia or hospital admission particularly in at risk groups.,there is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of oseltamivir for the prevention of influenza a and b in children., oseltamivir prophylaxis is effective in preventing febrile influenza a h1n1 virus infection in children and adults. however there is insufficient evidence to recommend its use as a first-line treatment for children with febriale influenza in adults or children with acute ot. further research is required to determine the optimal duration of prophyleaxis in children with influenza a and adults with severe acute otitis media and to determine whether it is effective for adults and children with severe oseltsamivirs.
233,squeezable bottles appear easier to use than rigid feeding bottles for babies born with clefts of the lip and/or palate however there is no evidence of a difference in growth outcomes between the bottle types. there is weak evidence that breastfeeding is better than spoon-feeding following surgery for cleft. there was no evidence to suggest that maxillary plates assist growth in babies with clefts of the palate. no evidence was found to assess the use of any types of maternal advice and/or support for these babies.,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of squeezable bottle feeding for cleft lip and palate in children with clefts., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of any of the interventions for cleft lip and palate. there is a need for well-designed adequately powered randomized controlled trials to evaluate the effectiveness of these interventions on feeding outcomes in cleft mouth and palate and to compare the effectiveness and safety of interventions for feeding outcomes. such trials should be conducted in low-income countries where nutritional interventions are not supported.
234,postoperative platinum based chemotherapy is associated with a small benefit in progression-free survival and overall survival irrespective of radiotherapy treatment. it reduces the risk of developing a metastasis could be an alternative to radiotherapy and has added value when used with radiotherapy.,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of adjuvant chemotherapy to treat patients with advanced stage endometrial cancer., there is insufficient evidence to support the use of adjuvant chemotherapy for endometrial cancer in patients with high-risk tumours. however there is a need for further well-designed controlled trials to evaluate the effects of this treatment on survival and progression-free survival in patients who are at high risk for recurrence and who are not at risk of developing tumour-specific complications.
235,there is limited evidence on which to base clinical decisions regarding the prescription of custom-made foot orthoses for the treatment of foot pain. currently there is gold level evidence for painful pes cavus and silver level evidence for foot pain in jia rheumatoid arthritis plantar fasciitis and hallux valgus.,there is insufficient evidence to support the use of orthoses for the treatment of plantar fasciitis. further research is needed to determine whether orthoses are more effective than sham orthoses in the management of pain., there is insufficient evidence to support the use of foot orthoses for the treatment of plantar fasciitis in finland. there is a need for further well-designed controlled trials to determine the optimal type of orthoses to assess the effectiveness of this intervention for foot pain and foot disability in people with rheumatoid arthritics. future research should focus on improving the quality of life in patients with a variety of types of foot pain types and on improving functional status.
236,the results of this review suggest that phakic iols are safer than excimer laser surgical correction for moderate to high myopia in the range of 6.0 to 20.0 d and phakic iols are preferred by patients. while phakic iols might be accepted clinical practice for higher levels of myopia greater than or equal to 7.0 d of myopic spherical equivalent with or without astigmatism it may be worth considering phakic iol treatment over excimer laser correction for more moderate levels of myopia less than or equal to 7.0 d of myopic spherical equivalent with or without astigmatism). further rcts adequately powered for subgroup analysis are necessary to further elucidate the ideal range of myopia for phakic iols.,there is insufficient evidence to support the use of laser in situ keratomileusis lasik for the treatment of myopia., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of ics for the treatment of myopic astigmatism in people with myopia. there is a need for further well-designed and reported trials to evaluate the effectiveness of icl for treating myopia with laser in situ keratomileus. these trials should be conducted in high-income countries with low risk of bias.
237,when the possible side-effects of standard treatment hypnotics are considered there is an argument to be made for clinical use of cognitive-behavioural treatments. research is needed to establish the likely predictors of success with such treatments. as it may well be the case that the treatment efficacy of cognitive-behavioural therapy itself is not durable the provision of top-up refresher sessions of cbt training to improve durability of effect are worthy of investigation.,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of cognitive-behavioral interventions for the management of insomnia., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of psychological therapies for the management of insomnia in older people with chronic and primary insomnia. however there is a need for well-designed adequately powered trials with adequate sample sizes and adequate follow-up periods to assess the effects of psychological interventions on sleep-maintenance insomnia in younger people with persistent and primary sleep disorders in older adults.
238,there was insufficient evidence from comparisons tested within randomised controlled trials to establish the relative effectiveness of different either custom-made or off-the-shelf finger splints used for treating mallet finger injury. there was a useful reminder that splints used for prolonged immobilisation should be robust enough for everyday use and of the central importance of patient adherence to instructions for splint use. there was insufficient evidence to determine when surgery is indicated.,there is insufficient evidence to support the use of perforated splints for the treatment of mallet finger deformity., simple splint is effective in correcting mallet finger deformity </interventions> simple splints may be effective in treating mallet-finger deformity but there is insufficient evidence to make any recommendations for clinical practice. further research is needed to determine the optimal splint type and to compare different types of splint types and to determine whether splints are more effective than non-spint types.
239,the studies in this review are limited by sample size which are often divided into multiple comparison groups. most comparisons showed no significant differences with wide confidence intervals. although extra-amniotic prostaglandins may be as effective as other modalities in initiating labour there is little conclusive information from this review to guide clinical practice. an adequately powered randomised controlled trial would be useful to determine if the use of extra-amniotic prostaglandins would lower the rate of caesarean section.,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of extra-amniotic prostaglandin e2 in the induction of labour., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of prostaglandin e2 for induction of labour in preigravidae. there is a need for further trials to evaluate the efficacy of prostiglandin ipsa and misoprostol in women with low bishop scores and to compare the efficacy and safety of these agents with placebo.
240,there was no clear evidence of any effect of corticosteroids on substantive clinical outcomes. those receiving steroids showed significantly greater improvement in platelet counts which was greater for those receiving dexamethasone than those receiving betamethasone. there is to date insufficient evidence of benefits in terms of substantive clinical outcomes to support the routine use of steroids for the management of hellp. the use of corticosteroids may be justified in clinical situations in which increased rate of recovery in platelet count is considered clinically worthwhile.,there is insufficient evidence to support the use of corticosteroids in the treatment of hellp syndrome., corticosteroids are effective in reducing the need for readmission to the obstetrical recovery room for women with hellp syndrome. there is insufficient evidence to support the routine use of these drugs in the treatment of women with ohp syndrome in order to prevent the development of hellp-susia. there are insufficient data to support their routine use in this form of treatment for women.
241,compulsory community treatment results in no significant difference in service use social functioning or quality of life compared with standard care. people receiving compulsory community treatment were however less likely to be victims of violent or non-violent crime. it is unclear whether this benefit is due to the intensity of treatment or its compulsory nature. evaluation of a wide range of outcomes should be considered when this type of legislation is introduced. note the five citations in the awaiting classification section of the review may alter the conclusions of the review once assessed.,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of court-ordered outpatient treatment for people with psychotic disorders., there is currently insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of enhanced services for the treatment of pre-existing conditions. further trials are needed to determine whether enhanced services are effective in treating pre preexisting conditions and to determine if enhanced services should be used as an adjunct to enhanced services in order to improve quality of life and to compare enhanced services with enhanced services. future trials should focus on improving the quality and quantity of life of pre pre-established conditions.
242,"despite collating more event data than previous systematic reviews of randomised controlled trials 665 deaths in some 6,250 participants there is still insufficient power to exclude clinically important effects of reduced dietary salt on mortality or cardiovascular morbidity in normotensive or hypertensive populations. our estimates of benefits from dietary salt restriction are consistent with the predicted small effects on clinical events attributable to the small blood pressure reduction achieved.",the is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of sodium reduction interventions in people with hypertension. further research is needed., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of dietary interventions to reduce diastolic blood pressure in people with high normal blood pressure. there is a need for well-designed controlled trials to evaluate the effects of dietary intervention on blood pressure and cardiovascular outcomes in older people with low normal levels of blood pressure as well as to assess the effects on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.

248,the studies included in this meta-analysis were generally small and methodologically prone to bias which makes it impossible to arrive at a definitive conclusion about the effectiveness of manipulative therapies for infantile colic. the majority of the included trials appeared to indicate that the parents of infants receiving manipulative therapies reported fewer hours crying per day than parents whose infants did not based on contemporaneous crying diaries and this difference was statistically significant. the trials also indicate that a greater proportion of those parents reported improvements that were clinically significant. however most studies had a high risk of performance bias due to the fact that the assessors parents were not blind to who had received the intervention. when combining only those trials with a low risk of such performance bias the results did not reach statistical significance. further research is required where those assessing the treatment outcomes do not know whether or not the infant has received a manipulative therapy. there are inadequate data to reach any definitive conclusions about the safety of these interventions.,therechiropractic spinal manipulation appears to be effective in reducing crying in infants with colic. however there is insufficient evidence to determine whether it is beneficial or harmful for infants. further research is needed., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of any of the interventions reviewed in this review. however there is a need for further well-designed and reported trials to evaluate the effects of interventions on infantile colic pain. such trials should be conducted in low-income countries where the incidence of crying is low and the number of infants included in the studies is small.
249,cabg is associated with reduced rates of major adverse cardiac events mostly driven by reduced repeat revascularisation. however the rct data are limited by follow-up unrepresentative samples and rapid development of both surgical techniques and stenting. research on real-world patient population or patient level data meta-analyses may identify risk factors and groupings who may benefit most from one strategy over the other.,there is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of coronary artery bypass grafting for angina pectoris in patients with lad., there is insufficient evidence to determine whether revascularization is beneficial for patients with high grade livessel disease. there is no evidence to support the use of revascularisation as a treatment for high grade lam lesion disease. however there is a need for more studies to determine the optimal treatment for these patients. future trials should focus on the optimal follow-up and on patients with low grade luressel disease as well as on patients who are at high risk of complications such as stroke and angina.

253,the available evidence indicates some beneficial effects with second-generation antipsychotics mood stabilisers and dietary supplementation by omega-3 fatty acids. however these are mostly based on single study effect estimates. antidepressants are not widely supported for bpd treatment but may be helpful in the presence of comorbid conditions. total bpd severity was not significantly influenced by any drug. no promising results are available for the core bpd symptoms of chronic feelings of emptiness identity disturbance and abandonment. conclusions have to be drawn carefully in the light of several limitations of the rct evidence that constrain applicability to everyday clinical settings among others patients characteristics and duration of interventions and observation periods).,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of antipsychotic drugs for the treatment of borderline personality disorder., there is insufficient evidence to support the use of scl-90 as monotherapy for borderline personality disorder in patients with borderline psychopathology. there is no evidence to suggest that the combination of sscalzine and phenelzine monotherapy is superior to the combination in treating borderline personality disorders in people with borderline- psychopathology in terms of schizotypal symptoms and borderline-spiratory disorders. no evidence is available to support or refute the treatment of borderline- personality disorder.
254,therapeutic aspiration in addition to metronidazole to hasten clinical or radiologic resolution of uncomplicated amoebic liver abscesses cannot be supported or refuted by the present evidence. the trials lack methodological rigour and adequate sample size to conclude on the presence of effectiveness of adjunctive image-guided aspiration plus metronidazole versus metronidazole alone. further randomised trials are necessary.,there is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to determine the effectiveness of amoebic liver aspiration in patients with ala., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of aspiration for amoebic liver abscesses. there is a need for well-designed randomised controlled trials to evaluate the effects of aspiration on clinical outcomes such as mortality and quality of life. future trials should focus on improving the quality and safety of aspiration and should include long-term follow-up of patients and follow-ups of patients.
255,the pregnancy rate was found to be higher when gnrha was used in a long protocol as compared to a short or ultrashort protocol. there was no evidence of a difference in live birth rate but this outcome was only reported by three studies. there was no evidence of a difference in the outcomes amongst various long protocols nor that stopping or reducing gnrha at the start of stimulation was associated with a reduced pregnancy rate. for all comparison except a long versus short protocol there was a lack of power.,there is insufficient evidence to support the use of gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists in ivf., gonadotrophins do not increase pregnancy rates and live birth rates in the first cycle of ivf cycles but there is insufficient evidence to support the use of long-term gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists for oocyte suppression in women undergoing in vitro hyperstimulation. there is no evidence to suggest that long-stay regimens are more effective than short-term regimens in improving live birth or pregnancy rates. there are insufficient data to support a recommendation for the routine treatment of women undergoing ivf during the first treatment cycle.
256,chemotherapy is effective in prolonging time to disease progression and survival in patients with advanced colorectal cancer. the survival benefit may be underestimated by this meta-analysis as a proportion of patients in the control arms of some trials received chemotherapy. no age related differences were found in the effectiveness of chemotherapy but elderly patients were under represented in trials. treatment toxicity and impact upon quality of life and symptom control have been inadequately assessed in the majority of trials and further research is needed to clarify the palliative benefit of chemotherapy.,there is insufficient evidence to support the use of primary chemotherapy in the treatment of colorectal cancer. further randomised controlled trials are needed., there is currently insufficient evidence to support the use of palliative chemotherapy for advanced colorectal cancer. however there is a need for further high quality randomised controlled trials to evaluate the effects of this intervention on survival and quality of life in patients with nonresectable liver metastases. these trials should be conducted in the context of well-designed placebo-controlled trials with adequate follow-up.
257,we consider the use of nact in women with stage iiic/iv ovarian cancer to be a reasonable alternative to pds particularly in bulky disease. with regard to selecting who will benefit from nact treatment should be tailored to the patient and should take into account resectability age histology stage and performance status. these results cannot be generalised to women with stage iiia and iiib ovarian cancer in these women pds is the standard. we await the results of three ongoing trials which may change these conclusions.,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy in the treatment of ovarian cancer., there is currently insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy for advanced ovarian cancer. however there is a need for further well-designed and reported trials to evaluate the efficacy and safety of this intervention in women with advanced ovarian cancers. such trials should be conducted in low-income countries and should be of high methodological quality and report on adverse events.
258,the findings indicate that music during planned caesarean section under regional anaesthesia may improve pulse rate and birth satisfaction score. however the magnitude of these benefits is small and the methodological quality of the one included trial is questionable. therefore the clinical significance of music is unclear. more research is needed to investigate the effects of music during caesarean section under regional anaesthesia on both maternal and infant outcomes in various ethnic pregnant women and with adequate sample sizes.,there is insufficient evidence to recommend routine care for women undergoing cesarean delivery. further research is needed to determine whether routine care and music therapy are beneficial or harmful for women who are planning to have a vaginal birth. more research is required to determine if routine care is beneficial for women experiencing cesarenal delivery., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of music therapy as a treatment for cesarean delivery. further research is needed to investigate the effectiveness of music therapies as treatment for women undergoing music therapy. note the four citations in the awaiting classification section of the review may alter the conclusions of the reviewed review once assessed. the review does not provide sufficient evidence to determine whether music therapy is effective in reducing anxiety in women undergoing cesarenan delivery or not.
259,hpv-triage with hc2 can be recommended to triage women with ascus because it has higher accuracy significantly higher sensitivity and similar specificity than repeat cytology. when triaging women with lsil an hc2 test yields a significantly higher sensitivity but a significantly lower specificity compared to a repeat cytology. therefore practice recommendations for management of women with lsil should be balanced taking local circumstances into account.,there is insufficient evidence to support the use of hsil for cervical cancer screening in women with atypical squamous cells., there is insufficient evidence to support the use of hybrid capture ii for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia for detecting cin 2/3 and cin in women with high-risk hsils and no evidence of dyskaryosis for cervical carcinoma or cervical cancers. there is no evidence for other types of cervical biopsies for hc in women who are atypia on papanicolaou smears. there are insufficient data to support a policy of using hyposcopy for the prevention of cin2/3 in the treatment of women with low-risk hav-positive women with hc-negative women with no risk of developing cin with hykaryotology for detecting hc2/proex c in women at increased risk hav with hypcts for developing cervical cancers and no studies for developing ci with hyx-based cytology for developing monposcopy in the control of hsild women with a policy to reduce the number of women who have been informed for colposcopy to prevent cin and no trials for developing rcts to prevent cervical cancers in developing countries.<sep<interventions>
260,breathing exercises over four to 15 weeks improve functional exercise capacity in people with copd compared to no intervention however there are no consistent effects on dyspnoea or health-related quality of life. outcomes were similar across all the breathing exercises examined. treatment effects for patient-reported outcomes may have been overestimated owing to lack of blinding. breathing exercises may be useful to improve exercise tolerance in selected individuals with copd who are unable to undertake exercise training however these data do not suggest a widespread role for breathing exercises in the comprehensive management of people with copd.,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of breathing exercises in people with copd., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of breathing-feedback for improving pulmonary function in people with copd in hong kong and hong sép. there is no evidence to suggest that breathing training is effective for improving lung function in copd patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. there are insufficient data to support the use and safety of breathing training for copd. future research should focus on improving the quality of life in patients with stable copd as well as on improving quality of hospital and on reducing dyspnoea and improving pulmonary-related quality of death.

262,methylphenidate clonidine guanfacine desipramine and atomoxetine appear to reduce adhd symptoms in children with tics. although stimulants have not been shown to worsen tics in most people with tic disorders they may nonetheless exacerbate tics in individual cases. in these instances treatment with alpha agonists or atomoxetine may be an alternative. although there is evidence that desipramine is effective for both tics and adhd in children safety concerns will likely continue to limit its use in this population.,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of methylphenidate in the treatment of tourette's syndrome., there is insufficient evidence to support the use of methylphenidate for treating tic disorders in tourette's syndrome. however there is a need for further well-designed controlled trials to investigate the efficacy of this treatment in children with tourette syndrome and comorbid tourette´s syndrome as well as to assess the safety and efficacy of desipramine for treating adhd in children.
263,the risk of rhesus d alloimmunisation during or immediately after a first pregnancy is about 1%. administration of 100 µg 500 iu anti-d to women in their first pregnancy can reduce this risk to about 0.2 without to date any adverse effects. although unlikely to confer benefit in the current pregnancy fewer women may have rhesus d antibodies in any subsequent pregnancy but the effects of this needs to be tested in studies of robust design.,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of anti-d immunoglobulin in the treatment of rhesus d positive infants., antepartum low-dose anti-d immunoglobulin appears to be effective in reducing immunosuppressant adverse events in people with preigravidae. however the evidence is insufficient to recommend its use as an effective treatment for pregravids. further research is needed to determine the optimal dose/dose/dose combination of antepatum low dose anti-dose and anti-diuretics for preventing immunoses and adverse effects in those with pre-ugravidae with pregrelids.
264,benefits of screening include a modest reduction in colorectal cancer mortality a possible reduction in cancer incidence through the detection and removal of colorectal adenomas and potentially the less invasive surgery that earlier treatment of colorectal cancers may involve.harmful effects of screening include the psycho-social consequences of receiving a false-positive result the potentially significant complications of colonoscopy or a false-negative result the possibility of overdiagnosis leading to unnecessary investigations or treatment and the complications associated with treatment.,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of biennial screening for colorectal cancer. further randomised controlled trials are needed., there is currently insufficient evidence to support or refute the routine use of biennial screening for colorectal cancer. however there is a need for further high quality randomised controlled trials with adequate follow-up to assess the effects of screening on mortality from colonoscopy and other types of cancer. these trials should be conducted in low-income countries with low risk of bias.

266,our review update included data from four new randomised studies of the ketogenic diet. although none were blinded some were of good quality. these studies suggest that in children the ketogenic diet results in short to medium term benefits in seizure control the effects of which are comparable to modern antiepileptic drugs. however one study of long term outcome reports a high attrition rate for the diet. this would suggest that many children find the diet difficult to tolerate. the main reasons for drop-outs in the included studies included gastrointestinal side effects and dislike for the diet. we found just three studies on the use of the diet in adults and none of these were randomised. there has been less research involving other diets. we found one randomised study of reasonable quality of the atkins diet. this study showed similar benefits in seizure control with a less restrictive diet. for those with medically intractable epilepsy or those in whom surgery is unsuitable a ketogenic diet could improve seizure control but tolerability is poor. one observational study suggested that the atkins diet may have a similar effect on seizure control but this requires more investigation.,theketogenic diet appears to be effective in reducing seizures in children with epilepsy. however there is no evidence to support the use of ketogenic diets for treating epilepsy in children., ketogenic diet appears to be effective in reducing seizure reduction in people with refractory epilepsy but there is insufficient evidence to support its use in children with epilepsy. there is no evidence to suggest that ketogenic diets are more effective than other anti-epileptic drugs for treating people with epilepsy with no apparent adverse effects. there are insufficient data to draw any conclusions about the effects of ketogenic foods on seizure reduction and seizure reduction for people with epilepsies.
267,mass mailing a printed bulletin which summarises systematic review evidence may improve evidence-based practice when there is a single clear message if the change is relatively simple to accomplish and there is a growing awareness by users of the evidence that a change in practice is required. if the intention is to develop awareness and knowledge of systematic review evidence and the skills for implementing this evidence a multifaceted intervention that addresses each of these aims may be required though there is insufficient evidence to support this approach.,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of oral analgesics in labour. further research is needed., there is currently insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of prophylactic antibiotics for women delivering preterm infants. there is a need for high quality trials to investigate the effectiveness of this intervention for women who are pregnant and to compare the effectiveness and safety of other types of antibiotics for this intervention. there are insufficient data to draw any conclusions about the effectiveness or safety of these interventions for women with preterm babies.
268,we included 25 rcts and found no compelling evidence to support any one psychosocial treatment over another to reduce substance use or improve mental state by people with serious mental illnesses. furthermore methodological difficulties exist which hinder pooling and interpreting results high drop out rates varying fidelity of interventions varying outcome measures settings and samples and comparison groups may have received higher levels of treatment than standard care. further studies are required which address these concerns and improve the evidence in this important area.,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of psychosocial interventions for people with schizophrenia and substance use disorders., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the effectiveness of psychosocial interventions for people with comorbid schizophrenia and alcohol use disorders. there is a need for more high-quality trials to investigate the effectiveness and safety of these interventions in reducing alcohol use and reducing drug use in people with alcohol and/or decreased alcohol use. there are insufficient data to support the effectiveness or safety of psychotherapy over other types of treatment for people who are in need of treatment or who are homeless.
269,timed-cycle sti have not been proven to be safe in the short term. although cd4-guided sti strategy has reported favorable outcomes in the short term the long-term safety efficacy and tolerability of this strategy has not been fully investigated. based on the studies we reviewed the evidence to support the use of timed-cycle sti and cd4-guided sti cycles as a standard of care in the management of chronic suppressed hiv infection is inconclusive.,there is insufficient evidence to support the use of haart in the management of hiv-1-infected patients with chronic hiv., there is insufficient evidence to support the use of haart for hiv-1-infected patients with severe hiv/1-specific cd4 t-cell suppression in the first stage of art. there is no evidence that haart is associated with a reduction in cd4 and cd4 cell counts in patients with highly active antiretroviral therapy haart and no evidence of a reduction of cd4 or cd8/ml in patients who are not immunodeficiency type 1 hiv 1-specific haart with no reduction in hiv or no reduction of hiv2/vl in patients treated with no treatment interruptions in the second stage of the art.

275,the available evidence from this review is of insufficient quantity and quality to draw any firm conclusions about the effects of self-management education for cystic fibrosis. further trials are needed to investigate the effects of self-management education on a range of clinical and behavioural outcomes in children adolescents and adults with cystic fibrosis and their caregivers.,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of behavioral home-based nutrition education for adults with cystic fibrosis., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of dietary interventions for cystic fibrosis. there is a need for well-designed adequately powered randomised controlled trials to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions for this condition. such trials should be conducted with adequate sample sizes and follow-up periods to assess the effect of interventions on quality of life outcomes.
276,there is no significant difference between once weekly versus thrice weekly subcutaneous administration of rhuepo. once weekly administration would require an additional 12 u/kg/wk for patients on haemodialysis however this is based on one very small study. cost of additional rhuepo needs to assessed with regard to patient preference and compliance.,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of human erythropoietin in capd., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of erythropoietin as a treatment for capd patients with capd. there is a need for further well-designed and reported trials to determine the optimal erythroietin dose dose dose and duration of administration. such trials should be conducted in patients with low-dose rhuepo.
277,evidence suggests that risperidone and olanzapine are useful in reducing aggression and risperidone reduces psychosis but both are associated with serious adverse cerebrovascular events and extrapyramidal symptoms. despite the modest efficacy the significant increase in adverse events confirms that neither risperidone nor olanzapine should be used routinely to treat dementia patients with aggression or psychosis unless there is severe distress or risk of physical harm to those living and working with the patient. although insufficient data were available from the considered trials a meta-analysis of seventeen placebo controlled trials of atypical neuroleptics for the treatment of behavioural symptoms in people with dementia conducted by the food and drug administration suggested a significant increase in mortality or 1.7). a peer-reviewed meta-analysis schneider 2005 of 15 placebo controlled studies nine unpublished found similarly increased risk in mortality or=1.54 95 ci 0.004 to 0.02 p=0.01 for the atypical neuroleptics.,there is insufficient evidence to support the use of olanzapine in the treatment of dementia., olanzapine and risperidone may be effective in treating antipsychotic symptoms associated with dementia. however there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of these drugs in the treatment of dementia. further research is needed to investigate the efficacy and safety of these agents in patients with dementia and to determine whether they are effective in reducing the risk of discontinuation.

279,itraconazole modifies the immunologic activation associated with allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis and improves clinical outcome at least over the period of 16 weeks. adrenal suppression with inhaled corticosteroids and itraconazole is a potential concern.,there is insufficient evidence to support the use of corticosteroids in the treatment of patients with allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis., antifungal agents are effective in treating aspergillosis abpa but there is insufficient evidence to recommend their use as an adjunctive treatment for the treatment of allergic bronchopulmonary asthma. further well-designed and reported trials are required to establish the efficacy of these agents in the management of asperigillosis in people with abpa.
280,the risk of bias in the included trials was moderate and the sample was small. hence although the data in this review show an effective treatment trend of edaravone for acute ischaemic stroke further large high-quality trials are required to confirm this trend.,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of edaravone in the treatment of acute ischaemic stroke., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of radical scavenger edaravone mci-186 <sep> for acute brain infarction. the results of this review suggest that there is a need for further well-designed and reported randomised controlled trials to evaluate the efficacy and safety of this intervention. such trials should be conducted in low-income countries with low risk of bias.
281,we conclude that despite promising immunological responses no clinically effective antigen-specific active immunotherapy is yet available for ovarian cancer. furthermore the adoption of guidelines to ensure uniformity in trial conduct response definitions and trial reporting is recommended to improve quality and comparability of immunotherapy trials.,the is insufficient evidence to determine whether anti-osm immunotherapy is effective in the treatment of ovarian cancer. further trials are needed., monoclonal antibody-restricted cd4 t cell-restricted c4 t cells and hla-dp4/cd4 eoc cells are more effective than no-idiotypic immunotherapy in women with advanced stages of ovarian cancer </interventions are associated with a decreased risk of adverse events and a reduced risk of severe toxicity. these results are based on a small number of studies and do not provide sufficient information to guide clinical practice.
282,in adolescents and adults with sub-optimal control on low dose ics monotherapy the combination of laba and ics is modestly more effective in reducing the risk of exacerbations requiring oral corticosteroids than a higher dose of ics. combination therapy also led to modestly greater improvement in lung function symptoms and use of rescue ß2 agonists and to fewer withdrawals due to poor asthma control than with a higher dose of inhaled corticosteroids. apart from an increased rate of tremor and less oral candidiasis with combination therapy the two options appear relatively safe in adults although adverse effects associated with long-term ics treatment were seldom monitored. in children combination therapy did not lead to a significant reduction but rather a trend towards an increased risk of oral steroid-treated exacerbations and hospital admissions. these trends raised concern about the safety of combination therapy in view of modest improvement in children under the age of 12 years.,there is insufficient evidence to support the use of inhaled corticosteroids in the treatment of asthma., monotherapy and combination therapy is effective in reducing exacerbations and reducing use of rescue corticosteroids in patients with moderate to severe asthma. ics should be withheld from patients with mild to moderate asthma because of the increased risk of severe exacerbations in patients who are not adequately controlled on low-dose ics. monotherapy is not supported by the evidence available in this review because of concerns about the safety and tolerability of monotherapy monotherapy.
283,the addition of corticosteroids reduces the incidences of acute gvhd grade i to iv and ii to iv. this reduction however did not show any effect on overall survival and disease-free survival. further randomised controlled studies are needed to evaluate if the timing of steroid administration has a significant influence on the outcome data on quality of life should be assessed systematically.,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of prophylactic mp for graft-versus-host disease in patients with gvhd., there is insufficient evidence to support the use of any of the 3-drug regimens for graft-versus-host disease in patients with acute gvhd. however there is a need for further well-designed rcts to evaluate the effectiveness of these regimens in patients receiving acute gvshd in patients who are at high risk for posttransplant relapse and to investigate the effect of other regimens such as mtx and mtx.
284,this update of the review published in 2004 incorporates additional trials and more mature data. it demonstrates the benefit of concurrent chemoradiation over radiotherapy alone or sequential chemoradiotherapy. patient selection is an important consideration in view of the added toxicity of concurrent treatment. uncertainty remains as to how far this is purely due to a radiosensitising effect and whether similar benefits could be achieved by using modern radiotherapy techniques and more dose intensive accelerated and or hyperfractionated radiotherapy regimens.,there is insufficient evidence to support the use of radiotherapy for non-small cell lung cancer in patients with nsclc., inoperable stage ii and iii non-small cell lung cancer is associated with a reduction in overall survival and a decrease in toxicity in patients with unresectable stage iii and ii-cell lung cancer<sep> chemoradiotherapy does not appear to be associated with an increase in toxicity but does not seem to affect overall survival or progression-free survival.
285,parenteral high dose methotrexate and sulfasalazine are the only two agents with well demonstrated published efficacy in psoriatic arthritis. the magnitude of the effect seen with azathioprine etretinate oral low dose methotrexate and perhaps colchicine suggests that they may be effective but that further multicentre clinical trials are required to establish their efficacy. furthermore the magnitude of the improvement observed in the placebo group strongly suggests that uncontrolled trials should not be used to guide management decisions in this condition.,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of ssz for the treatment of psoriatic arthritis. there is a need for further trials., there is insufficient evidence to support the routine use of psa for psoriatic arthritis in rheumatology patients. however there is evidence that psa may be more effective than placebo in reducing pain and improving muscle improvement in psoriasis arthritis. there is no evidence that sasp is associated with a reduction in pain or improvement in muscle weakness in patients with psa.
286,the quantity and especially quality of data are low. analysis shows a reduction in overall complications but major complications were not reduced. length of stay was reduced significantly. we state that eras seems safe but the quality of trials and lack of sufficient other outcome parameters do not justify implementation of eras as the standard of care. within eras protocols included no answer regarding the role for minimally invasive surgery i.e. laparoscopy was found. furthermore protocol compliance within eras programs has not been investigated while this seems a known problem in the field. therefore more specific and large rct's are needed.,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of a fast-track approach to colonic surgery., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of any of the strategies for bowel resection for bowel or intestinal resection. however there is a need for high quality randomised controlled trials to assess the effectiveness of these strategies in bowel and intestinal resections for bowel/oral resection and to compare the effectiveness and safety of these approaches to bowel resections.
287,the included studies provide strong evidence for increased ferritin and transferrin saturation levels together with a small increase in haemoglobin in patients with ckd who were treated with iv iron compared with oral iron. from a limited body of evidence we identified a significant reduction in esa requirements in patients treated with iv iron and found no significant difference in mortality. adverse effects were reported in only 50 of included studies. we therefore suggest that further studies that focus on patient-centred outcomes are needed to determine if the use of iv iron is justified on the basis of reductions in esa dose and cost improvements in patient quality of life and with few serious adverse effects.,there is insufficient evidence to support the use of intravenous iron in patients with ckd. further trials are needed., there is insufficient evidence to support the routine use of erythropoietin therapy for treating patients with ckd with no iron or no iron. no iron was associated with adverse events in patients treated with intravenous iron. there is no evidence that iron supplementation is associated with any adverse effects in people treated with iv iron or iv iron. the evidence is insufficient to determine whether iron supplementation should be used as an adjunct to iron supplementation in patients with severe hemodialysis or not on dialysis.
288,patients with parkinson's disease who receive treadmill training are more likely to improve their impaired gait hypokinesia. however the results must be interpreted with caution because there were variations between the trials in patient characteristics the duration and amount of training and types of treatment. additionally it is not known how long these improvements may last.,there is insufficient evidence to support the use of treadmill training for parkinson's disease. further trials are needed to determine whether treadmill training is superior to treadmill training in the prevention of pd., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the effectiveness of treadmill training for parkinson's disease pd. there is evidence that treadmill training is effective in improving walking speed and improving balance in pd but there is no evidence that it is effective for other types of pd such as walking speed or balance. further trials are required to determine whether treadmill training has any beneficial effects on walking speed in pdd and to assess the effects on balance gait speed and stride length.
289,due to insufficient good quality data and lack of randomised studies it is impossible to determine whether drug treatment is safe and effective in the treatment of myotonia. larger well-designed randomised controlled trials are needed to assess the efficacy and tolerability of drug treatment for myotonia.,there is insufficient evidence to support the use of oral taurine in the treatment of myotonic dystrophy., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of antiarrhythmic drugs for myotonia in myotonic dystrophy. there is a need for further well-designed and reported trials to evaluate the efficacy and safety of these drugs in treating dystrostrophy and to determine whether they are safe and effective in treating myotonics in people with dystrophia or not.
290,the use of prophylactic steroids in pediatric patients to reduce postoperative complications commonly experienced following cardiopulmonary bypass surgery is not supported by the existing evidence. further well designed and adequately powered randomized controlled trials are needed to more accurately estimate the benefit and harm of this intervention.,there is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of methyl prednisolone for the prevention of cardiopulmonary heart disease., dexamethasone is effective in reducing the volume of preoperative and intraoperative mp in children undergoing cpb. however there is insufficient evidence to support its use as an effective treatment for congenital heart disease. further trials are needed to determine the optimal dose and duration of steroid administration in children with congenital cardiac disease. these trials should be of high methodological quality and should be powered to detect clinically important differences between different doses.
291,based on these four studies two of which were subgroups of small numbers of eligible toddlers from larger studies there is insufficient evidence of the analgesic effects of sweet tasting solutions or substances during acute painful procedures in children over one year of age. further well-conducted rcts are warranted in this population.,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of lidocaine-prilocaine during immunization in infants., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of any intervention for preventing adverse effects of immunization in preterm infants. there is a need for high quality randomised controlled trials with adequate follow-up to determine the optimal intervention for prevention of adverse effects in infants with immunization during immunization. such trials should be conducted in high-income countries.
292,at present there is insufficient rct evidence to enable evaluation of the effect of tpd in patients with aki. well-designed and larger rcts are required to better understand the risks and benefits of tpd for aki.,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of tpd for the treatment of hypercatabolic arf in patients with tpd. further research is needed to determine whether tpd is superior to cepd in terms of clearances of arf., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of tpd therapy for hypercatabolic arf who are assigned to the hypercatabolites. further trials are needed to determine whether tpd is effective in hypercatablation or in combination with other therapies. these trials should be conducted in high-income countries with low risk of bias and should be of high quality.
293,the review indicates low level evidence for the positive effects of neuropsychological rehabilitation in ms. interventions included in the review were heterogeneous. consequently clinical inferences can basically be drawn from single studies. therefore new trials may change the strength and direction of the evidence. to further strengthen the evidence well-designed high quality studies are needed. in this systematic review recommendations are given for improving the quality of future studies on the effects of neuropsychological rehabilitation in ms.,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of cognitive training in people with ms. there is a need for more well-designed well-conducted and well-controlled trials., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the effectiveness of cognitive training for people with ms. there is a need for further high quality randomised controlled trials with adequate follow-up to assess the effects of training on cognitive impairment and behaviour disorders in people with advanced ms. future research should focus on improving the quality of life and on improving patient-centred clinical outcomes in patients with mild to moderate cognitive impairment.
294,both tcas and ssris are effective for depression treated in primary care.,the is insufficient evidence to support the use of antidepressants in primary care. further research is needed to confirm the effectiveness of antidepressants for treating depression., amitriptyline and sertraline are effective in treating depression in general practice but are associated with adverse events such as nausea and headache. however there is insufficient evidence to support their use as an effective treatment in patients with major depression. there is a need for further trials to investigate the effectiveness of these drugs in treating major depression in primary care and to compare them with other treatments such as antidepressants.
295,there is silver level evidence www.cochranemsk.org to support the efficacy of strontium ranelate for the reduction of fractures vertebral and to a lesser extent non-vertebral in postmenopausal osteoporotic women and an increase in bmd in postmenopausal women with/without osteoporosis. diarrhea may occur however adverse events leading to study withdrawal were not significantly increased. potential vascular and neurological side-effects need to be further explored.,there is insufficient evidence to support the use of strontium ranelate in the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the routine use of strontium ranelate for prevention of vertebral and hip fractures in women with osteoporosis. however there is a need for further well-designed controlled trials with adequate sample sizes and adequate follow-up to determine the optimal dose and duration of use for these women. note the four citations in the awaiting classification section of the review once assessed.
296,pgs as currently performed significantly decreases live birth rates in women of advanced maternal age and those with repeated ivf failure. trials in which pgs was offered to women with a good prognosis suggested similar outcomes. pgs technique development is still ongoing in an effort to increase its efficacy. this involves biopsy at other stages of development polar body or trophectoderm biopsy and other methods of analysis comparative genome hybridisation cgh or array-based technologies than used by the trials included in this review. these new developments should be properly evaluated before their routine clinical application. until such trials have been performed pgs should not be offered as routine patient care in any form.,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of preimplantation genetic screening in women with advanced maternal age. further research is needed to determine the optimal use of pgs., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of pgs for women with advanced maternal age. however there is evidence that pgs may be beneficial in improving pregnancy outcomes in ama couples with preimplantation genetic screening. there is no evidence to suggest that any specific pgs type should be used for ama patients with advanced pregnancy age. further research is required to determine whether pgs is beneficial for women who are at increased risk of miscarriage and to assess the effects on live birth.
297,t-tube drainage appeared to result in significantly longer operating time and hospital stay compared with primary closure without any apparent evidence of benefit on clinically important outcomes after open common bile duct exploration. based on the currently available evidence there is no justification for the routine use of t-tube drainage after open common bile duct exploration in patients with common bile duct stones. t-tube drainage should not be used outside well designed randomised clinical trials. more randomised trials comparing the effects of t-tube drainage versus primary closure after open common bile duct exploration may be needed. such trials should be conducted with low risk of bias and assessing the long-term beneficial and harmful effects of t-tube drainage including long-term complications such as bile stricture and recurrence of common bile duct stones.,there is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to determine whether primary closure is a safe and cost effective alternative to t-tube drainage after open choledochotomy., primary closure versus t-tube drainage is a safe and effective alternative to primary closure in patients with biliary lithiasis after choledochotomy. however there is insufficient evidence to support the routine use of primary closure over t-tub drainage after primary closure. further research is required to determine the optimal closure technique and to compare the effectiveness of this approach with other methods of closure.
298,the range of proven effective interventions for chronic pelvic pain remains limited and recommendations are based largely on single studies. given the prevalence and healthcare costs associated with chronic pelvic pain in women randomised controlled trials of other medical surgical and psychological interventions are urgently required.chronic pelvic pain is common in women in the reproductive and older age groups and it causes disability and distress that result in significant costs to health services. the pathogenesis of chronic pelvic pain is poorly understood. often investigation by laparoscopy reveals no obvious cause for the pain. there are several possible explanations for chronic pelvic pain including undetected irritable bowel syndrome and central sensitisation of the nervous system. a vascular hypothesis proposes that pain arises from dilated pelvic veins in which blood flow is markedly reduced. as the pathophysiology of chronic pelvic pain is not well understood its treatment is often unsatisfactory and limited to symptom relief. currently the main approaches to treatment include counselling or psychotherapy attempts to provide reassurance using laparoscopy to exclude serious pathology progestogen therapy such as with medroxyprogesterone acetate and surgery to interrupt nerve pathways.,there is insufficient evidence to support the use of psychotherapy in women with chronic pelvic pain. there is a need for more rigorous well-designed and well-conducted randomised controlled trials., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of any of the commonly used analgesics for treating pelvic pain in women with chronic pelvic pain. there is a need for further well-designed trials to investigate the effectiveness of these agents in treating pelvic symptoms in women who are at increased risk of pelvic congestion and for other types of pelvic pain such as acute abdominal pain and for women with adverse events.
299,while cocs containing 20 μg ee may be theoretically safer this review did not focus on the rare events required to assess this hypothesis. data from existing randomized controlled trials are inadequate to detect possible differences in contraceptive effectiveness. low-dose estrogen cocs resulted in higher rates of bleeding pattern disruptions. however most trials compared cocs containing different progestin types and changes in bleeding patterns could be related to progestin type as well as estrogen dose. higher follow-up rates are essential for meaningful interpretation of results.,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of oral contraceptives for the prevention and maintenance of menstrual bleeding., oral contraceptives are safe and well tolerated for women with normal menstrual cycles. however there is insufficient evidence to support the routine use of oral contraceptives for women who are wishing to take oral contraceptives. women should be aware of the increased risk of breakthrough bleeding and increased discontinuation rates when using oral contraceptives over a period of one year. women are also more likely to discontinuate when taking oral contraceptives when using a combination of two low-dose oral contraceptives with one high-dose ocp.
300,the data from five trials comparing differing washout policies were sparse and trials were generally of poor quality or poorly reported. the evidence was too scanty to conclude whether or not washouts were beneficial. in the first instance we require further rigorous high quality trials with adequate power to detect any benefit from washout being performed as opposed to none. then trials comparing different washout solutions washout volumes frequencies/timings and routes of administration are needed.,there is insufficient evidence to support the use of antibiotics in the treatment of neurogenic bladder. further trials are needed to assess the effectiveness of antibiotics for bladder drainage and to determine whether antibiotics are effective., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the routine use of bladder washouts/instillations for indwelling catheters. there is a need for further well-designed and reported trials to evaluate the effectiveness of this intervention for bladder washout-instillation. these trials should be conducted in low-income countries and should be powered to detect clinically important adverse effects such as catheter obstructions.
301,there was no evidence to suggest a shortened fluid fast results in an increased risk of aspiration regurgitation or related morbidity compared with the standard nil by mouth from midnight fasting policy. permitting patients to drink water preoperatively resulted in significantly lower gastric volumes. clinicians should be encouraged to appraise this evidence for themselves and when necessary adjust any remaining standard fasting policies nil-by-mouth from midnight for patients that are not considered at-risk during anaesthesia.,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of intravenous fluids in elective surgical procedures. there is a need for further research., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of preoperative oral fluids for preoperative abdominal surgery in patients with a physical status i and ii. there is no evidence to suggest that preoperative fluids are more effective than no pre-operative fluids for preventing aspiration prophylaxis in women with a physiological status i-ii and a decreased gastric volume and ph. there are insufficient data to support the routine use of oral fluids to prevent aspiration in women.
302,we found no evidence to support the use of hydroxyurea in addition to radiotherapy in the routine treatment of cervix cancer.,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of hydroxyurea in the treatment of stage iib cervical cancer., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of hydroxyurea for women with stage iib cervical cancer. there is a need for further well-designed and reported trials to determine the optimal therapy for stage iiib cervix. these trials should be conducted in the context of aortic lymphadenectomy and should be powered to detect clinically important differences in survival and quality of life outcomes between patients with different types of uterine tumours.
303,ketanserin may have some efficacy in the treatment of raynaud's phenomenon secondary to scleroderma. overall ketanserin is not significantly different from placebo for the treatment of raynaud's phenomenon except for some decrease in the duration of attacks and more subjects improved on ketanserin compared to placebo. however there were more side effects and the frequency of attacks actually favored placebo. it can be concluded that ketanserin treatment in raynaud's phenomenon secondary to scleroderma is not clinically beneficial.,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of ketanserin for the treatment of raynaud's phenomenon., ketanserin is effective in treating scleroderma and raynaud's phenomenon. however there is insufficient evidence to recommend its use as an adjuvant for the treatment of sclerodma or raynauds's phenomenon in people with sclerogma. further trials are required to determine the optimal dose and route of administration for this treatment and to assess the optimal duration of treatment.
304,internal fixation is associated with less initial operative trauma but has an increased risk of re-operation on the hip. definite conclusions cannot be made for differences in pain and residual disability between the two groups. future studies should concentrate on better reporting of final outcome measures and function. there is still a need for studies to define which patient groups are better served by the different treatment methods.,there is insufficient evidence to support the use of internal fixation for displaced femoral neck fractures. further research is needed., there is insufficient evidence to support the use of internal fixation for displaced intracapsular hip fractures in older patients. there is no evidence that internal fixation is associated with a reduction in the risk of hip complications in patients aged 65 to 79 years. there are no studies comparing internal fixation with internal fixation over internal fixation in patients who had undergone osteosynthesis in the same setting.
305,further studies are needed to compare chemoradiation versus thermoradiation versus chemoradiation plus hyperthermia in well selected/conducted and quality controlled randomised trials.,there is insufficient evidence to support the use of radiotherapy plus hyperthermia in the treatment of locally advanced cancer., there is insufficient evidence to support the use of radiotherapy for locally advanced cervical tumours in the treatment of locally advanced rectal cancer. however there is evidence that radiotherapy may be effective in improving survival and improving quality of life in locally advanced tumours. there is a need for further well-designed controlled trials to determine whether radiotherapy is effective and safe in locally invasive tumours and to compare radiotherapy with radiotherapy.
306,there is not sufficient evidence to support or refute the use of d-penicillamine for patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis. we do not recommend the use of d-penicillamine for patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis outside randomised trials.,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of penicillamine in the treatment of cholangitis., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the routine use of anticholinergics in cholangitis. further trials are needed to determine whether anticholergics should be used in this setting. these trials should be of high methodological quality and should be powered to detect clinically important adverse effects such as adverse events such as death and disability.
307,we detected no difference in the effect on parasites and clinical illness for intrarectal quinine but most trials were small. pain may be less with intrarectal proprietary buffered quinine preparations made less acidic by adjustment of the ph to 4.5). further larger trials in patients with severe malaria and in adults are required before the intrarectal route can be recommended.,there is insufficient evidence to support the use of intravenous quinine for the treatment of acute malaria in children., there is insufficient evidence to support the use of hydrochloride preparations for the treatment of severe malaria in children. there are insufficient data to support their use in children with severe malaria who are unable to take oral treatment. there is a need for further high quality trials in this population to determine the optimal route of administration for severe malaria and to determine which route is the most appropriate for this treatment for children with mild malaria.
308,in this review of randomized controlled trials of interventions designed to enhance partner support for smokers in cessation programmes we failed to detect an increase in quit rates. limited data from several of the trials suggest that these interventions also did not increase partner support. no conclusions can be made about the impact of partner support on smoking cessation. additional studies with larger samples are needed to adequately explore the effects of partner support interventions for smoking cessation.,there is insufficient evidence to support the use of social support for smoking cessation in smokers. there is a need for more well-designed well-conducted well designed and well-controlled trials to evaluate the effectiveness of social supports for quitting., there is insufficient evidence to support smokers quit with self-help materials for reducing smoking. there is a need for high quality trials to evaluate the effectiveness of self-support materials for smoking cessation. the results of this review suggest that there is an urgent need for well-designed and reported trials to assess the effectiveness and safety of interventions to help smokers quit.
309,"implications for practice no trials were found addressing treatment of vvc in hiv positive women.in comparison to placebo,fluconazole was found to be an effective preventative intervention. however the potential for resistant candida organisms to develop might impact the feasibility of implementation. direction of findings suggests that clotrimazole and lactobacillus improved the prophylactic outcomes when compared to placebo. implications for researchthere is a need to evaluate drugs and drug regimens for vvc treatment and prophylaxis in hiv positive women through randomised clinical trials. development of resistance to azoles remains under-studied and more work must be done in this area so as to determine whether routine prophylaxis for vvc is at all needed or whether adequate art would be sufficient to prevent recurrent vvc. the viral load in vaginal secretions with or without treatment or prophylaxis has not been studied this is very relevant to the spread of hiv.",there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of fluconazole prophylaxis in women with hiv infection., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of anticholinergics for hiv infection. there is a need for further well-designed and reported trials to assess the effectiveness of antitholinergic drugs for hich infection. these trials should be conducted in hiv-infected women with a history of mucosal candidiasis and should include adequate follow-up periods.
310,there is no reliable evidence from the trials reviewed concerning the effect of spinal as compared to general anaesthesia on the incidence of post-operative apnoea bradycardia or oxygen desaturation in ex-preterm infants undergoing herniorrhaphy. the estimates of effect in this review are based on a total population of only 108 patients or fewer. a large well designed randomised controlled trial is needed to determine if spinal anaesthesia reduces post-operative apnoea in ex-preterm infants not pretreated with sedatives. adequate blinding follow up and intention to treat analysis are required.,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of spinal anaesthesia for the treatment of postoperative apnea., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of supplemental caudal analgesia for preterm infants undergoing inguinal herniorrhaphy. there is a need for further well-designed controlled trials to evaluate the effects of supplemental anaesthesia on neonatal outcomes such as neurocardiorespiratory complications and neurodevelopmental complications.
311,this review found no evidence that metformin treatment before or during art cycles improves live birth or pregnancy rates. the risk of ohss in women with pcos and undergoing ivf or icsi cycles was reduced with metformin. further large rcts are necessary to definitively answer if the use of metformin in pcos women undergoing art improves live birth and pregnancy rates.,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of metformin in the treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of hydrocortisone for women with pcos. however there is a need for further well-designed trials to determine the optimal dose and duration of hydrovortic treatment for pcos in women with polycystic ovary syndrome. there is also a need to evaluate the effects of other treatments for women undergoing ivf/icsi and to assess the effects on pregnancy outcomes.
312,the use of ddi and to a lesser extent ddc delayed both hiv disease progression and death at least when added to azt.,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of zidovudine alone or zalcitabine alone in hiv-1-infected patients., there is insufficient evidence to support the use of zidovudine monotherapy in hiv-infected patients. however the available trials are too small to draw any definite conclusions on the effectiveness of zidsovudines monotherapy for hiv disease. however we do not plan to update this review until new trials are available. we are therefore unable to make any recommendations regarding the optimal combination therapy for patients with hiv/hiv disease because of the limited number of studies included in this review.
313,this review provided limited evidence that multi-media social marketing campaigns can promote hiv testing among msm in developed countries. future evaluations of social marketing interventions for msm should employ more rigorous study designs. long-term impact evaluations changes in hiv or sti incidence over time are also needed. implementation research including detailed process evaluation is needed to identify elements of social marketing interventions that are most effective in reaching the target population and changing behaviours.,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of social media in the management of syphilis in men., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of social marketing campaigns for promoting sex with men in south florida. further research is needed to investigate the effectiveness of social interventions for promoting sexual intercourse with men with women with sex with women and to assess the effects of interventions on sexual satisfaction with men and their partners with sexual intercourse and to determine whether interventions are effective in promoting sexual satisfaction among men with sexual partners.
314,we found evidence of moderate quality that radiation decreases the risk of disease progression compared with no further treatment but little evidence that it might improve overall survival in stage ib cervical cancer. the evidence on serious adverse events was equivocal.,there is insufficient evidence to support the use of radical hysterectomies in the treatment of stage ib cervical cancer., there is currently insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of postoperative radiotherapy for women with stage ib cervical cancer with negative lymph nodes. there is a need for further well-designed randomised controlled trials to evaluate the effects of this intervention on women's quality of life and progression-free survival in women with advanced stage stage women with early stage stage cervical cancer.
315,pramipexole can be used to reduce off time improve motor impairments and disability and reduce levodopa dose at the expense of increased dyskinetic adverse events. this conclusion is based on short and medium term trials up to 24 weeks). further trials are required to directly compare the newer with the older dopamine agonists.,the is insufficient evidence to support the use of antiparkinsonian dopamine agonists for the treatment of parkinson's disease., pramipexole is effective in treating motor fluctuations in advanced parkinson's disease. however there is insufficient evidence to support its use as an adjuvant for pd patients. further well-designed and reported trials are required to determine its safety and tolerability and to compare its efficacy to placebo in patients with advanced pd with other types of pd.
316,repetitive task training resulted in modest improvement in lower limb function but not upper limb function. training may be sufficient to impact on daily living function. however there is no evidence that improvements are sustained once training has ended. the review potentially investigates task specificity rather more than repetition. further research should focus on the type and amount of training and how to maintain functional gain.,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of task-oriented rehabilitation for people with stroke. further trials are needed to confirm the effectiveness of task oriented rehabilitation for stroke rehabilitation., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of task-oriented interventions for improving walking ability after acute stroke after discharge from physiotherapy. there is no evidence to suggest that rehabilitation is associated with improvements in functional independence after discharge following acute stroke </interventions> we recommend that rehabilitation should be used as an adjunct to rehabilitation for people with residual walking difficulties after discharge after discharge of physiotherapy in patients with acute stroke.
317,methotrexate may have a small steroid sparing effect in adults with asthma who are dependent on oral corticosteroids. however the overall reduction in daily steroid use is probably not large enough to reduce steroid-induced adverse effects. this small potential to reduce the impact of steroid side-effects is probably insufficient to offset the adverse effects of methotrexate.,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of methotrexate in the treatment of asthma., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of oral steroids for the treatment of steroid-dependent asthma. there is a need for well-designed controlled trials to determine whether oral steroids are effective in reducing the need for steroid therapy in steroid dependent asthma. these trials should be conducted in patients with steroid dependent asthmatic patients with asthma who require oral steroids to reduce the requirement of steroid therapy.
318,both small trials had significant risks of bias and do not provide reliable evidence on the effects of surgery for cervical spondylotic radiculopathy or myelopathy. it is unclear whether the short-term risks of surgery are offset by long-term benefits. further research is very likely to have an impact on the estimate of effect and our confidence in it. there is low quality evidence that surgery may provide pain relief faster than physiotherapy or hard collar immobilization in patients with cervical radiculopathy but there is little or no difference in the long-term. there is very low quality evidence that patients with mild myelopathy feel subjectively better shortly after surgery but there is little or no difference in the long-term.,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of mri-verified cervical root compression in patients with mild myelopathy., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of physiotherapy for women with mri-verified cervical root compression without medullary compression. there is a need for well-designed adequately powered randomised controlled trials to evaluate the efficacy and safety of different physiotherapy types for cervical root compressions. such trials should be conducted in low-income countries with low risk of bias and should be of high quality.
319,we do not know whether pq added to treatment regimens for patients with p. falciparum infection reduces transmission of malaria. in individual patients it reduces gametocyte prevalence and density. in practical terms even if pq results in large reductions in gametocytes in people being treated for malaria there is no reliable evidence that this will reduce transmission in a malaria-endemic community where many people are infected but have no symptoms and are unlikely to be treated. since pq is acting as a monotherapy against gametocytes there is a risk of the parasite developing resistance to the drug. in terms of harms there is insufficient evidence from trials to know whether the drug can be used safely in this way in populations where g6pd deficiency occurs. in light of these doubts about safety and lack of evidence of any benefit in reducing transmission countries should question whether to continue to use pq routinely in primary treatment of malaria. further synthesis of observational data on safety and new trials may help elucidate a role for pq in malaria elimination or in situations where most infected individuals are symptomatic and receive treatment.,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of primaquine in the treatment of malaria in children., pq and artesunate-pyrimethamine are effective in reducing parasitaemia in people with p. falciparum and vivax in areas of south west asia and in areas with low density p. parasitology in areas where pq is not available for the treatment of uncomplicated p. pq-mosaemia is effective in decreasing parasitological cure of pq but no studies were identified for other types of monotherapy. no studies have been identified for this review.
320,for participants with partial onset seizures oxcarbazepine is significantly less likely to be withdrawn but current data do not allow a statement as to whether oxcarbazepine is equivalent superior or inferior to phenytoin in terms of seizure control. however the design of the studies may have biased seizure outcomes and misclassification of epilepsy type may have biased withdrawal rates.,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of phenytoin monotherapy in the treatment of epilepsy., there is currently insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of oxcarbazepine monotherapy for epilepsy. however there is a need for well-designed adequately powered trials with adequate sample sizes and adequate follow-up periods to determine the optimal dose and duration of treatment for people with epilepsy. such trials should be conducted in people with pre-existing epilepsy and should be powered to detect clinically important differences in efficacy and safety.
321,the lack of a positive effect of d-cycloserine on cognitive outcomes in controlled clinical trials with statistical power high enough to detect a clinically meaningful effect means that d-cycloserine has no place in the treatment of patients with alzheimer's disease.,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of d-cycloserine in the treatment of alzheimer's disease., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of cycloserine in the treatment of alzheimer's disease. however there is a need for further well-designed and reported trials to determine its efficacy and safety in the management of this disease. these trials should be conducted in the context of well designed and reported randomised controlled trials with appropriate outcome measures.
322,caution is required in interpreting the results given the methodological limitations of the included trials in terms of internal and external validity. further the size and clinical meaningfulness of statistically significant results are uncertain. however given the risks of untreated depression in terms of completed suicide and impacts on functioning if a decision to use medication is agreed then fluoxetine might be the medication of first choice given guideline recommendations. clinicians need to keep in mind that there is evidence of an increased risk of suicide-related outcomes in those treated with antidepressant medications.,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of fluoxetine for the treatment of major depression in children and adolescents., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of antidepressants in children and adolescents with depression. there is a need for further well-designed controlled trials to determine whether antidepressants are effective and safe in this population. the results of this review suggest that antidepressants may be more effective than placebo in treating depression in young people with unipolar disorder. however there is no evidence to suggest that they are more effective or safe than placebo.
323,we found insufficient evidence to support or refute the efficacy of routine very early mobilisation after stroke compared with conventional care. more research is required to determine the benefits and harms of very early mobilisation after stroke.,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of vem in the treatment of stroke. there is a need for further randomised controlled trials to determine whether vem is safe and effective., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the routine use of pre-treatment interventions for preventing stroke in people with pre-stroke stroke. further research is needed to determine the optimal intervention for preventing strokes in people who are at high risk of stroke and to determine whether pretreatment interventions are effective in preventing stroke and its adverse effects. future trials should include long-term follow-up and outcome measures such as mortality and adverse effects as well as outcome measures.
324,active management is associated with small reductions in the cs rate but it is highly prescriptive and interventional. it is possible that some components of the active management package are more effective than others. further work is required to determine the acceptability of active management to women in labour.,there is insufficient evidence to support the use of active management of labour in women with low risk of labour., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of epidural analgesics for women in spontaneous labour. women should be informed of the risks of maternal and neonatal morbidity and should be encouraged to take part in future trials. note the four citations in the awaiting classification section of the review may alter the conclusions of the reviews once assessed in full-term trials.
325,cervical manipulation and mobilisation produced similar changes. either may provide immediate or short-term change no long-term data are available. thoracic manipulation may improve pain and function. optimal techniques and dose are unresolved. further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate.,the is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of chiropractic spinal manipulation in the management of cervical pain., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of manipulation for cervical neck pain in addition to cervical manipulation for neck pain and neck disability in patients with neck pain. there is no evidence that manipulation is associated with neck disability or reduction in cervical range of motion in patients who are unable to tolerate physiotherapy. there are insufficient data to support any treatment modalities for cervical pain in people with cervical spine dysfunction.
326,the available evidence is limited and the internal validity of these trials is questionable. given the high losses to follow up these reports may even be considered observational. given that caveat the biphasic pill containing norethindrone was associated with inferior cycle control compared with the triphasic pill containing levonorgestrel. the choice of progestin may be more important than the phasic regimen in determining bleeding patterns.,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of oral contraceptives for preventing intermenstrual bleeding. there is a need for further trials., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of biphasic and one triphasic regimens for women with premenstrual bleeding. there is a need for high quality randomized controlled trials to evaluate the efficacy of these regimens in women with postmenstruals. such trials should be conducted in low-dose regimens with adequate follow-up to determine the optimal dose and duration.
327,the analysis of the five included trials comparing intravenous versus oral steroid therapy for ms relapses do not demonstrate any significant differences in clinical benefits and adverse events radiological or pharmacological outcomes. based on the evidence oral steroid therapy may be a practical and effective alternative to intravenous steroid therapy in the treatment of ms relapses.,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of oral steroids for the treatment of ms. further research is needed., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of methylprednisolone in the treatment of ms. however there is a need for further well-designed and reported trials to determine the optimal dose and route of administration for the management of ms and to assess the efficacy and safety profiles of different oral steroids. these trials should be powered to detect clinically important differences between different oral steroid regimens and to evaluate the effects of different systemic regimens.
328,from the limited available evidence spironolactone appears to lower blood pressure compared to placebo to a similar degree in patients with primary essential hypertension when doses of 100-500 mg/day are given. a dose of 25 mg/day did not statistically significantly reduce systolic or diastolic blood pressure compared to placebo. given the lack of a dose-response coupled with a possible increased risk in adverse events with higher doses doses of 25 to 100 mg/day are reasonable. there is no evidence of the effect of spironolactone on clinical outcomes in hypertensive patients.,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of spironolactone in the management of hypertension in people with hypertension., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of spironolactone in the treatment of essential hypertension. there is a need for well-designed and reported randomised controlled trials to evaluate its efficacy in preventing blood pressure hypertension in hypertensive patients. such trials should be conducted in high-income countries with low blood pressure and should be powered to detect clinically important blood pressure lowering events.
329,the use of conventional systemic corticosteroids in patients with clinically quiescent crohn's disease does not appear to reduce the risk of relapse over a 24 month period of follow-up. an updated literature search performed in july 2008 did not identify any new trials.,there is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of antibiotics in the treatment of active symptomatic crohn's disease., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of anti-inflammatory drugs for crohn's disease. however there is a need for well-designed adequately powered randomised controlled trials to evaluate the efficacy and safety of these drugs in patients with active disease. such trials should be conducted in the context of a randomized controlled trial with adequate follow-up to assess the effectiveness of these agents.
330,olanzapine is an effective treatment for mania and may be more efficacious than divalproex though leads to more weight gain. clinicians should consider both the relative efficacy and the different incidence of specific adverse effects of available drugs.,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of olanzapine in the treatment of manic or mixed episodes., olanzapine is effective in the treatment of acute bipolar disorder and is associated with a reduction in dry mouth and somnolence compared with placebo. however there is insufficient evidence to support its use as an adjunctive treatment for acute mania. further trials are required to determine the optimal dose and duration of olanzoapine and to determine its safety and efficacy.
331,it is not possible to conclude about the use of any kind of pharmacologic therapies for maintenance treatment of opium dependence.,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of baclofen in the treatment of opioid dependence in people with opioid dependence., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of opioid dependence as an add-on treatment for opioid dependent patients. we recommend that opioid dependence should be treated with the dsm-iv criteria for opioid dependence. we suggest that opioids should not be used as add-ons in the treatment of opioid dependent individuals with opioid dependence because of adverse effects such as opioid craving and dependence.
332,the results of this systematic review indicate that virtual reality endoscopy training can be used to effectively supplement early conventional endoscopy training apprenticeship model in diagnostic oesophagogastroduodenoscopy colonoscopy and/or sigmoidoscopy for health professions trainees with limited or no prior endoscopic experience. however there remains insufficient evidence to advise for or against the use of virtual reality simulation-based training as a replacement for early conventional endoscopy training apprenticeship model for health professions trainees with limited or no prior endoscopic experience. there is a great need for the development of a reliable and valid measure of endoscopic performance prior to the completion of further randomised clinical trials with high methodological quality.,the is insufficient evidence to support the use of computer-based endoscopy training for colonoscopy., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of endoscopy simulator training as an adjunct to bedside training in patients with limited endoscopic experience. the majority of studies included in this review were of low methodological quality and did not provide sufficient power to detect clinically important differences between the two types of endoscopic simulator training. however there is a need for more high quality trials to investigate the effectiveness and safety of this type of simulator for patients with no experience in endoscopic training.
333,pacifier use in healthy term breastfeeding infants started from birth or after lactation is established did not significantly affect the prevalence or duration of exclusive and partial breastfeeding up to four months of age. however evidence to assess the short-term breastfeeding difficulties faced by mothers and long-term effect of pacifiers on infants health is lacking.,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of a pacifier in breastfeeding. further research is needed to determine the effectiveness of pacifier use in breastfeeding and breastfeeding at different ages and duration., there is currently insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of pacifiers for breastfeeding women or infants in montreal quebec. there is a need for well-designed adequately powered trials to investigate the effectiveness of pacifier use in breastfeeding women and infants in this setting. such trials should be conducted in high-income countries. the findings of this review should be interpreted with caution as they are based on a small number of studies with low risk of bias.
334,none of the three studies found that medication prior to transfusion reduces nhtr. this applied regardless of the patient's history of nhtr and the use of leukodepleted blood products in the transfusion. however this conclusion is based on three trials of moderate to low quality. a better-powered rct is necessary to evaluate the role of pretransfusion medication in the prevention of nhtr. inclusion criteria should be restricted to patients at high risk of developing nhtr with no restriction by age history of transfusion reactions and type of blood products leukodepleted or not).,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of anti-histamines in transfusion febrile reactions., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of hydrocortisone over placebo for the prevention of febrile reactions in adults. however there is a need for further randomised controlled trials to evaluate the effectiveness of this intervention in adults with febriale reactions. these trials should be of high methodological quality and should be powered to detect clinically important differences in outcomes.
335,there is insufficient evidence to know if the effects of unit-dose packaged antimalarial drugs reduce treatment failure. unit-dose packaging supported by prescriber training and patient information appears to improve participant-reported treatment adherence but these data come from trials with methodological limitations.,there is insufficient evidence to support the use of blister packs in the treatment of malaria. further research is needed to determine whether blister packs are effective in reducing the cost of treatment., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of antimalarial drugs in the treatment of plasmodium vivax malaria. there is a need for well-designed and reported trials to evaluate the effectiveness of these interventions in reducing adverse events in people with malaria. such trials should be conducted in high-income countries where the incidence of adverse events is low and the number of participants is low.
336,pedestrian safety education can result in improvement in children's knowledge and can change observed road crossing behaviour but whether this reduces the risk of pedestrian motor vehicle collision and injury occurrence is unknown. there is evidence that changes in safety knowledge and observed behaviour decline with time suggesting that safety education must be repeated at regular intervals.,the is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of roadside training in children. further research is needed to determine the effectiveness of road-side training for children., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of interventions to improve safety in young people. there is a need for high quality trials to investigate the effects of interventions on adverse effects on childhood outcomes and to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions for improving safety in children. such trials should be conducted in settings with low incidence of adverse effects such as adverse effects of alcohol abuse and adverse effects.
337,we found four rcts which reported mortality and bleeding data. it is not possible to determine whether human activated protein c recombinant human soluble thrombomodulin tranexamic acid and dermatan sulphate are effective or harmful for patients presenting with dic related to acute or chronic leukemia. the effects of these interventions need to be tested in sufficiently powered rcts. outcome measures should include in-hospital mortality from any cause overall mortality incidence of resolution of respiratory failure renal failure shock and safety. the definition of bleeding should be standardized in these patients.,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of heparin in the treatment of dic. there is a need for further trials., there is currently insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of heparin for the treatment of acute leukaemia. however there is a need for well-designed adequately powered trials with adequate follow-up to evaluate the efficacy and safety of this intervention. such trials should be conducted in the context of well designed adequately powered placebo-controlled trials with appropriate outcome measures.
338,antibiotics covering aerobic and aerobic bacteria should be delivered orally and intravenously prior to colorectal surgery. antibiotics delivered within this framework will reduce the risk of postoperative swi by at least 75%. further research is required to establish the optimal timing and duration of dosing and frequency of longer-term adverse effects such as clostridium difficile pseudomembranous colitis.,the is insufficient evidence to determine whether prophylaxis is more effective than oral antibiotics in the prevention of wound infection., prophylaxis for colorectal surgery is effective in reducing the risk of postoperative wound infection and reducing the incidence of septic complications in patients with no history of intra-abdominal complications. no evidence is available to support the use of antibiotics for the prevention of wound infection in patients undergoing elective colonic surgery. no studies were identified for the reduction of wound infections in the included studies. none of the studies included in the meta-analysis was identified as being of low methodological quality and therefore no conclusions can be drawn for the inclusion of the review.
339,there is not enough evidence to evaluate the use of nutrient therapy for suspected impaired fetal growth. the studies were too small to assess clinical outcomes adequately.,there is insufficient evidence to support the use of carnitine for the treatment of fetal retardation in women with fgr., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of any of the interventions for women with placental insufficiency. there is a need for well-designed adequately powered trials to evaluate the efficacy and safety of interventions for this condition. such trials should be conducted in low-income countries and should be of high methodological quality. note the four citations in the awaiting classification section of the review may alter the conclusions of the reviewed review once assessed.
340,there were more deaths and more rebleeding in the transfusion arms of the combined studies but the small numbers of participants and large volume of missing data limit the significance of the findings. the studies in this review do not provide useful data regarding outcomes following red blood cell transfusion for acute upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage. they appear to exclude large survival benefit. large well-concealed rcts of sufficient power are urgently needed.,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of blood transfusion in acute gastrointestinal haemorrhage., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of early blood transfusion for acute abdominal haemorrhage in cirrhagic patients. however there is a need for further well-designed and reported randomised controlled trials to evaluate the effects of early-blood transfusion on acute haemodilution in acute abdominal hemorrhage in patients with cirrhage.
341,depot perphenazine is in clinical use in the nordic countries belgium portugal and the netherlands. at a conservative estimate a quarter of a million people suffer from schizophrenia in those countries and could be treated with depot perphenazine. the total number of participants in the four trials with useful data is 313. none of the studies observed the effects of oral versus depot antipsychotic drugs. until well conducted and reported randomised trials are undertaken clinicians will be in doubt as to the effects of perphenazine depots and people with schizophrenia should exercise their own judgement or ask to be randomised.,there is insufficient evidence to support the use of perphenazin-enanthate in the treatment of schizophrenia. further trials are needed to determine the effect of per phenazin in the management of schizophrenia and its symptoms., prephenazin-enanthate and clopenthixol decanoate may be effective in reducing hostility hypochondria and autonomic symptoms in schizophrenia patients. however there is insufficient evidence to support the use of these drugs in the treatment of schizophrenia patients in finland. further research is needed to investigate the efficacy of these interventions in treating schizophrenia patients and to determine whether they are effective in treating hostility hypothyochondria or other adverse effects.
342,the very limited evidence from the included studies suggests that sns can improve continence in selected people with faecal incontinence and reduce symptoms in selected people with constipation. however temporary percutaneous stimulation for a two-to-three week period does not always successfully identify those for whom a permanent implant will be beneficial. larger good quality randomised crossover trials are needed to allow the effects of sns for these conditions to be assessed with more certainty.,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of sacral nerve stimulation in the treatment of fecal incontinence. further trials are needed., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of sacral nerve stimulation for fecal incontinence in adults. there is a need for well-designed adequately powered randomized controlled trials to evaluate the efficacy and safety of this intervention in adults with fecal and incontontinence. such trials should be conducted in low-income countries with low risk of bias and should be powered to detect clinically important adverse effects.
343,currently there is insufficient evidence to recommend routine screening of asymptomatic or symptomatic pregnant women with tvu cl. since there is a non-significant association between knowledge of tvu cl results and a lower incidence of ptb at less than 37 weeks in symptomatic women we encourage further research. future studies should look at specific populations separately e.g. singleton versus twins symptoms of ptl or no such symptoms report on all pertinent maternal and perinatal outcomes and include cost-effectiveness analyses. most importantly future studies should include a clear protocol for management of women based on tvu cl results so that it can be easily evaluated and replicated.,there is insufficient evidence to support the use of ultrasound for the management of preterm labour in women with threatened preterm labor. further randomised controlled trials are needed., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of corticosteroids for women with threatened preterm labour. further trials are needed to determine the role of corticsosteroids in preventing preterm birth. note the four citations in the awaiting classification section of the review may alter the conclusions of the reviewed review once assessed. note also the six citations in awaiting classification sections of the reviews may alter our conclusions once assessed in the light of the results of the new review once reviewed.
344,no donors are superior to placebo or no treatment but inferior to prostaglandins for first-trimester cervical ripening and associated with more side effects.,the isosorbide mononitrate is effective in preventing cervical ripening before surgical evacuation of the uterus. however there is insufficient evidence to support its use in women undergoing surgical abortion., isosorbide mononitrate and misoprostol are effective in preventing cervical ripening prior to first trimester surgical evacuation of the uterus but there is insufficient evidence to support the use of these regimens as an alternative to other methods of cervix ripening in women undergoing suction evacuation of pregnancy. there is no evidence to suggest that any of the regimens are more effective than no treatment or no treatment. there are insufficient data to make any recommendations for clinical practice.
345,there is no evidence for any short-term or long-term advantage in peritoneal closure for non-obstetric operations. if further trials are performed on this topic they should have an adequate period of follow-up and adequate measures should be taken to ensure that the results are not subject to bias.,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of two-layer closures for abdominal surgery. there is a need for further research., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of suture of the peritoneal closure after lateral paramedian incision for laparotomy in patients undergoing abdominal abdominal surgery. further trials are required to determine whether suture is effective in the management of abdominal abdominal surgical wounds and to determine the optimal position for suture for abdominal surgery in patients with acute abdominal abdominal procedures.
346,the evidence from randomised controlled trials for the treatment of igg or iga paraproteinaemic neuropathy is currently inadequate. more randomised controlled trials of treatments are required. these should have adequate follow-up periods and contain larger numbers of participants perhaps through multicentre collaboration considering the relative infrequency of this condition. observational or open trial data provide limited support for the use of treatments such as plasma exchange cyclophosphamide combined with prednisolone intravenous immunoglobulin and corticosteroids. these show potential therapeutic promise but the potential benefits must be weighed against adverse effects. their optimal use and the long-term benefits need to be considered and validated with well-designed randomised controlled trials.,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of plasma exchange as a treatment for neuropathy. further trials are needed to determine whether plasma exchange is effective in treating neuropathy in people with neuropathic disorders., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of plasma exchange as a treatment for neuropathy and mgus of the igg iga or sham plasma exchange. further trials are needed to determine whether plasma exchange is effective in improving neuropathy or mgus and to determine if plasma exchange should be used as an alternative to plasma exchange in neuropathy treatment.
347,while brief counselling interventions have been identified as successful ifor adults when delivered by physicians this cannot be extrapolated to adults as parents in child health settings. however there is limited support for more intensive counselling interventions for parents in such contexts. there is no clear evidence of differences between the respiratory non-respiratory ill child well child and peripartum settings as contexts for reduction of children's ets exposure.,the is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of behavioural interventions to reduce smoking in children with asthma., there is insufficient evidence to support mothers and fathers for reducing smoking in the home and reducing children's exposure to environmental tobacco ets in their homes. these studies are limited to studies of low-income families and therefore should be interpreted cautiously as they are likely to be effective in reducing children with asthma and reduce children's symptoms in their own health. the studies were small to moderate to low-intensity groups and did not show a statistically significant effect on children's asthma and reduced children's respiratory symptoms.
348,aroma therapy showed benefit for people with dementia in the only trial that contributed data to this review but it is important to note there were several methodological difficulties with this study. more well designed large-scale rcts are needed before clear conclusions can be drawn on the effectiveness of aroma therapy. additionally several issues need to be addressed such as whether different aroma therapy interventions are comparable and the possibility that outcomes may vary for different types of dementia.,there is insufficient evidence to support the use of aromatherapy in the treatment of people with dementia. there is a need for further research., aromatherapy is effective in reducing agitated behaviours in people with dementia. however there is insufficient evidence to support its use as an adjunctive therapy for people with severe dementia. further research is needed to determine the effectiveness and safety of this intervention for patients with mild cognitive impairment and to assess the effects of other therapies on agitation in dementia patients with severe cognitive impairment such as anticholinergics.
349,the review identified no significant differences for the primary outcomes perinatal mortality preterm birth less than 34 weeks gestation and childhood neurodevelopmental handicap although the number of studies and participants was small. while treatment with heparin appears promising with a reduction in pre-eclampsia eclampsia and infant birthweight less than the 10th centile for gestational age the number of studies and participants included was small and to date important information about serious adverse infant and long-term childhood outcomes is unavailable. further research is required. note the 14 citations in the awaiting classification section of the review may alter the conclusions of the review once assessed.,there is insufficient evidence to support the use of dalteparin in the management of pre-eclampsia. further trials are needed., there is insufficient evidence to support the routine use of thrombophilia in pre-eclampsia. however there is a need for further well-designed and reported trials to assess the effects of this intervention on pregnancy outcomes. such trials should be conducted in pregnant women with severe pre-esclampsiae. note the four citations in the awaiting classification section ofthe review may alter the conclusions of the review once assessed.
350,there was limited and low quality data providing insufficient evidence to assess the effectiveness of pedometer interventions in the workplace for increasing physical activity and improving subsequent health outcomes.,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of pedometer-based exercise interventions for health-related outcomes. further research is needed., there is currently insufficient evidence to support or refute the effectiveness of interventions to improve health-related outcomes in shift workers. there is a need for well-designed adequately powered randomised controlled trials with adequate sample sizes and adequate follow-up to determine whether interventions are beneficial for shift workers with metabolic syndrome or whether interventions should be used as an adjunct to other types of physical activity and nutrition programmes.
351,mao-b inhibitors more specifically selegiline which contributes most of the data do not appear to delay disease progression in terms of improved survival but may reduce later motor fluctuations. at present we do not feel these drugs can be recommended for routine use in the treatment of early parkinson's disease.,there is insufficient evidence to support the use of levodopa in the treatment of parkinson's disease. there is a need for further randomised controlled trials., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of dopamine agonists for parkinson's disease as monotherapy. however there is a need for further well-designed controlled trials to determine the optimal dose and duration of therapy for early pd. the current available evidence is insufficient to support the routine use of these agents in early parkinson´s disease.
352,this review demonstrated that there is insufficient evidence to draw definitive conclusions regarding the impact of educational or behavioural interventions on ttr in af patients receiving oat. thus more trials are needed to examine the impact of interventions on anticoagulation control in af patients and the mechanisms by which they are successful. it is also important to explore the psychological implications for patients suffering from this long-term chronic condition.,there is insufficient evidence to support the use of self-management in the management of atrial fibrillation., oral anticoagulant therapy is effective in reducing stroke and hemorrhagic complications in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. however there is insufficient evidence to support its use as an effective treatment for people with non-valvalvalbillation. future trials should focus on patients with low risk of major bleeding and on patients who are at high risk of stroke and who are more likely to experience major bleeding.
353,calcimimetic treatment of shpt leads to significant improvements in biochemical parameters that observational studies have shown to be associated with increased mortality cardiovascular risk and osteitis fibrosa but patient-based benefits have not yet been demonstrated in trials. for patients with shpt the benefits of calcimimetics over standard therapy remain uncertain until further rcts become available.,there is insufficient evidence to support the use of calcium-phosphorus in the treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of vitamin d sterols for treating secondary hyperparathyroidism in end-stage renal disease. there is a need for further well-designed controlled trials to evaluate the effects of calcium-d sterols in this patient group and to assess the safety of calcium and calcium-containing agents in this population. the trials should be powered to detect clinically important adverse events.
354,based on the limited data available moderate-term prednisone treatment of ra appears to be superior to placebo and comparable to treatment with aspirin or chloroquine in improving several common rheumatoid arthritis disease activity measures.,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of chloroquine in the treatment of ra., there is currently insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of prednisone over chloroquine for the treatment of ra. further trials are needed to confirm the efficacy and acceptability of these drugs in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. these trials should be of high methodological quality and should be powered to detect clinically important differences in outcomes. future trials should focus on outcomes such as quality of life and adverse effects.
355,family intervention may reduce the number of relapse events and hospitalisations and would therefore be of interest to people with schizophrenia clinicians and policy makers. however the treatment effects of these trials may be overestimated due to the poor methodological quality. further data from trials that describe the methods of randomisation test the blindness of the study evaluators and implement the consort guidelines would enable greater confidence in these findings.,there is insufficient evidence to support the use of family-based interventions in the management of schizophrenia. further research is needed., there is insufficient evidence to support family-based interventions for people with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorders. however there is a need for more studies to investigate the effects of family-oriented interventions for patients with schizophrenia. there is no evidence to suggest that families-based intervention are more effective than no treatment or no treatment in people with schizoective disorders and there is also no evidence of a reduction in the number of people who need hospitalisation or need for care as well as a decrease in time-to-relapse.
356,the pooled evidence derived from trials of gabapentin suggests that it is not efficacious for the prophylaxis of episodic migraine in adults. since adverse events were common among the gabapentin-treated patients it is advocated that gabapentin should not be used in routine clinical practice. gabapentin enacarbil is not efficacious for the prophylaxis of episodic migraine in adults. there is no published evidence from controlled trials of pregabalin for the prophylaxis of episodic migraine in adults.,there is insufficient evidence to support the use of gabapentin enacarbil for migraine., gabapentin is effective in treating migraine with or without aura. however there is insufficient evidence to recommend its use as a prophylactic for migraine. further trials are needed to determine its efficacy and safety in combination with other drugs such as anticholinergics and to assess its safety and tolerability in other types of migraine. trials should be conducted in patients with acute migraine.
357,overall we found neither evidence that the addition of pte to antineoplastic treatment reduced the risk of death or disease progression nor that it improved the rate of tumour responses to antineoplastic treatment. for thymosin α1 there was a trend for a reduced risk of dying and of improved dfs. there was preliminary evidence that pte lowered the risk of severe infectious complications in patients undergoing chemotherapy or radiotherapy.,there is insufficient evidence to support the use of thymosin in the treatment of patients with metastatic cancer., there is insufficient evidence to support the use of thymosin as monotherapy in patients with advanced non-small cell cell carcinoma. there is a need for further trials to determine the optimal combination therapy for this tumour type and to assess the combination of monotherapy and monotherapy for tumour-related toxicities. the combination should be used in combination with monotherapy to improve survival and reduce febrile episodes and to reduce the risk of infection.
358,the data available are inadequate to assess any potential benefit or harm that might result from hyperventilation in severe head injury. randomised controlled trials to assess the effectiveness of hyperventilation therapy following severe head injury are needed.,there is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to support the use of thromethamine in the management of cerebral ischemia., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of prolonged hyperventilation in the treatment of head injury. further trials are needed to confirm the efficacy and safety of this intervention in patients with head injury and to determine its effectiveness in reducing the risk of death and other adverse events. future trials should focus on improving the quality of life of patients with severe head injury as well as on assessing the effect of this treatment on mortality and adverse events in people with head injuries.
359,we found only low quality evidence on the use of chemotherapy in malignant germ cell tumours of the ovaries. therefore we are unable to reach definite conclusions about the relative benefits and harms of chemotherapy use in this disease regardless of disease stage. due to the benefit of chemotherapy in germ cell cancer of the testis a trial of chemotherapy versus best supportive care is unlikely to be feasible. despite this good quality randomised studies are warranted in this disease to define the role of chemotherapy type of chemotherapy duration of treatment benefit short and long term toxicities). given the rarity of this disease we feel a trans-global approach would be essential in order to perform such trials.,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of bap in the treatment of ovarian germ cell tumors., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the routine use of preoperative chemotherapy in the treatment of mogct. however there is a need for further well designed and reported randomised controlled trials to evaluate the efficacy and safety of postoperative chemotherapy for this condition. such trials should be conducted in high-quality settings with adequate follow-up and adequate outcome measures to assess the effectiveness and safety.
360,insertion of an iud immediately after abortion is safe and practical. iud expulsion rates appear higher than after interval insertions. however iud use is higher at six months with immediate than with interval insertion.,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of iuds for preventing pregnancy. there is a need for further trials to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of intrauterine contraceptive devices in preventing pregnancy in women with pre-abortion pregnancies., mirena and novat may be effective in reducing the incidence of novates but the quality of the evidence is very low. there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of any of the other contraceptive methods in the treatment of novsat. further research is needed to determine the most effective contraceptive methods and to determine whether the most appropriate contraceptive methods are effective in women with novatis.
361,studies evaluated in this review report significant improvements in knowledge measures and protective behaviours. results might have differed had the true iccs from studies been available or cluster-adjusted results been available. several studies reported harms suggesting a need to monitor the impact of similar interventions. retention of knowledge should be measured beyond 3-12 months. further investigation of the best forms of presentation and optimal age of programme delivery is required.,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of videotape in the prevention of sexual abuse in children. there is a need for further research., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the effectiveness of child sexual abuse prevention programs for preventing sexual abuse in children. there is a need for high quality high quality trials to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of child abuse prevention programmes for prevention in children with mild mental retardation. future research should focus on improving the quality of life of children with severe mental disorders and on identifying the most effective interventions for prevention programs.
362,both desipramine and paroxetine show a trend towards efficacy in depression in ms the short term but both treatments were associated with adverse effects with significantly more patients treated with paroxetine suffering from nausea or headache. further clinical research on the treatment of depression in ms is clearly needed. future trials should address the efficacy and tolerability in the long term and compare antidepressant treatments head-to-head.,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of desipramine for the treatment of depression in ms., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the efficacy of interventions for the treatment of multiple sclerosis. however there is a need for further well-designed and reported trials to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions in treating multiple sclerosis and to compare the efficacy and safety of interventions with other types of treatments. these trials should be conducted in the context of well designed and reported randomised controlled trials.
363,we could not find convincing evidence to support or refute endoscopic biliary stenting on the mortality in patients with pancreatico-biliary malignancy. large randomised trials are needed to settle the question of pre-surgical biliary stenting.,there is insufficient evidence to support the use of endoscopic biliary drainage in the treatment of pancreatic head carcinoma., preoperative biliary drainage was associated with a higher incidence of cholangitis and intraoperative bleeding than preoperative endoscopic drainage. however there is insufficient evidence to make any recommendations for the treatment of obstructive jaundice because of the lack of high quality randomised controlled trials. future trials should focus on patients with malignant obstructive obstruction and on patients who are most likely to benefit from this intervention.
364,the findings of this review suggest that oral naltrexone did not perform better than treatment with placebo or no pharmacological agent with respect to the number of participants re-incarcerated during the study period. if oral naltrexone is compared with other pharmacological treatments such as benzodiazepine and buprenorphine no statistically significant difference was found. the percentage of people retained in treatment in the included studies is however low 28%). the conclusion of this review is that the studies conducted have not allowed an adequate evaluation of oral naltrexone treatment in the field of opioid dependence. consequently maintenance therapy with naltrexone cannot yet be considered a treatment which has been scientifically proved to be superior to other kinds of treatment.,there is insufficient evidence to support the use of naltrexone in the treatment of heroin addicts. further research is needed to determine the optimal dose and duration of treatment., naltrexone is effective for maintenance of relapse and reduction of hiv risk behaviours in opioid-dependent patients. however there is insufficient evidence to support its use as an add-on treatment for treatment of opioid dependence in opioid dependent patients. the available evidence is insufficient to support or refute its use in this population. further trials are required to determine the optimal dose and duration of maintenance of treatment for opioid dependence and to assess the efficacy and safety of other add-ons.
365,increasing the ph of lidocaine decreased pain on injection and augmented patient comfort and satisfaction.,there is insufficient evidence to support the use of buffered lidocaine in the treatment of open carpal tunnel decompression., there is insufficient evidence to support the use of alkalinised lidocaine as a local anesthetic for lignocaine in the treatment of local anaesthetic complications. there is no evidence to suggest that alkalinization is superior to other local anesthetics for pain during local anaesthesia. there are insufficient data to draw any conclusions about the effect of alkalized lidocane on pain in the management of local anesthesia.
366,although antibiotic treatment is effective for children with uti there are insufficient data to answer the question of which type of antibiotic or which duration is most effective to treat symptomatic lower uti. this review found that 10-day antibiotic treatment is more likely to eliminate bacteria from the urine than single-dose treatments. no differences were observed for persistent bacteriuria recurrence or re-infection between short and long-course antibiotics where the antibiotic differed between groups. this data adds to an existing cochrane review comparing short and long-course treatment of the same antibiotic who also reported no evidence of difference between short and long-course antibiotics.,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of antifungal antibiotics for the treatment of urinary tract infections., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of antibiotic therapy for treating uncomplicated utis in children. there is a need for further well-designed and reported trials to determine whether antibiotic therapy is effective in treating utis with antibiotics in children and adults. the current evidence is insufficient to support the routine use of antibiotics for treating urinary tract infections in children with utis. there are insufficient data to make any recommendations for clinical practice.
367,the evidence from this review suggests that there are no clinically meaningful bp lowering differences between available arbs. the bp lowering effect of arbs is modest and similar to ace inhibitors as a class the magnitude of average trough bp lowering for arbs at maximum recommended doses and above is 8/-5 mmhg. furthermore 60 to 70 of this trough bp lowering effect occurs with recommended starting doses. the review did not provide a good estimate of the incidence of harms associated with arbs because of the short duration of the trials and the lack of reporting of adverse effects in many of the trials.,there is insufficient evidence to support the use of oral steroids for the management of hypertension in patients with moderate to moderate hypertension., hypertensive drugs are effective in lowering diastolic blood pressure in patients with mild to moderate hypertension. the reduction in sbp and sesbp is associated with a reduction in blood pressure and a decrease in systolic bp in patients treated with aldosterone monotherapy. the decrease of sbp was associated with an increase in blood-pressure lowering in people treated with an antihypertective class. the increase in sisbp and decrease in people with elevated blood pressure at 1-receptor bp and a decreased decrease in those treated with monotherapy and those treated in patients who are at high risk of cardiovascular events and discontinuations.
368,this systematic review suggests that the use of external stents following pancreaticoduodenectomy may be beneficial. however only a limited number of rcts with rather small sample sizes were available. further rcts on the use of stents after pancreaticoduodenectomy are warranted.,there is insufficient evidence to support the use of external drainage stent for pancreatic fistula in patients undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy., pj with external stent is associated with a lower risk of pancreatic fistula and a higher risk of gastric emptying compared with no stent. however there is insufficient evidence to draw any conclusions about the effect of pj on mortality. further research is required to determine the optimal route of drainage for pj and to compare the effects of this intervention with other types of drainage in patients undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy.
369,despite concerns surrounding the use of opioids for long-term management of chronic lbp there remain few high-quality trials assessing their efficacy. the trials in this review although achieving high internal validity scores were characterized by a lack of generalizability inadequate description of study populations poor intention-to treat analyses and limited interpretation of functional improvement. based on our results the benefits of opioids in clinical practice for the long-term management of chronic lbp remain questionable. therefore further high-quality studies that more closely simulate clinical practice are needed to assess the usefulness and potential risks of opioids for individuals with chronic lbp.,there is insufficient evidence to support the use of analgesics in the treatment of chronic back pain. further trials are needed to determine whether analgesics are effective in treating chronic pain., tramadol/acetaminophen combination tablets are effective in reducing pain and improving function in people with lbp. however there is insufficient evidence to support their use as an effective treatment for people with low-back pain. further trials are required to determine the optimal dose and duration of analgesia and to assess the safety of tramadols and acetaminophen combinations in patients with lower-back conditions.
370,the limited evidence suggests that home management is cost effective and preferred by patients. further large trials comparing these treatments are unlikely to occur. therefore home treatment is likely to become the norm further research will be directed to resolving practical issues.,there is insufficient evidence to support the use of heparin in the management of patients with deep-vein thrombosis., there is insufficient evidence to support the use of unfractionated heparin for the treatment of venous thrombosis in patients with acute leg dvt. there is a need for more high-molecular-weight heparins to be used as a first line treatment for this condition. there are no studies available to support or refute the routine use of ufh as a second line treatment in people with acute limbs dvt with no evidence of pulmonary embolism or major bleeding.
371,educational or counselling interventions may improve completion of treatment for latent tuberculosis. as would be expected the magnitude of the benefit is likely to depend on the nature of the intervention and the reasons for low completion rates in the specific setting.,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of educational interventions for the treatment of latent tuberculosis., there is currently insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of interventions to improve the quality of life of people with tuberculosis infection. however there is a need for high quality high quality trials to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions for tuberculosis infection in people with latent tuberculosis infection and to investigate the efficacy of interventions on tuberculosis treatment outcomes such as tuberculosis-specific outcomes and outcomes. future research should focus on improving the quality and quantity of treatment and on the prevention of tuberculosis infections.
372,gtr has a greater effect on probing measures of periodontal treatment than open flap debridement including improved attachment gain reduced pocket depth less increase in gingival recession and more gain in hard tissue probing at re-entry surgery. however there is marked variability between studies and the clinical relevance of these changes is unknown. as a result it is difficult to draw general conclusions about the clinical benefit of gtr. whilst there is evidence that gtr can demonstrate a significant improvement over conventional open flap surgery the factors affecting outcomes are unclear from the literature and these might include study conduct issues such as bias. therefore patients and health professionals need to consider the predictability of the technique compared with other methods of treatment before making final decisions on use. since trial reports were often incomplete we recommend that future trials should follow the consort statement both in their conduct and reporting. there is therefore little value in future research repeating simple small efficacy studies. the priority should be to identify factors associated with improved outcomes as well as investigating outcomes relevant to patients. types of research might include large observational studies to generate hypotheses for testing in clinical trials qualitative studies on patient-centred outcomes and trials exploring innovative analytic methods such as multilevel modelling. open flap surgery should remain the control comparison in these studies.,the is insufficient evidence to determine whether gtr is effective in preventing or reducing intrabony defects. further research is required to determine the optimal method of gtr., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of any specific technique for the treatment of oroximal periodontal defects. the majority of studies included in this review were of low methodological quality and did not provide sufficient evidence to determine the optimal technique for this treatment. there is a need for well-designed controlled trials to determine which technique is the most appropriate for the most effective technique for oroids in this setting. the current evidence is insufficient to support the routine use of this technique.
373,this review indicates that swimming training is well-tolerated in children and adolescents with stable asthma and increases lung function moderate strength evidence and cardio-pulmonary fitness high strength evidence). there was no evidence that swimming training caused adverse effects on asthma control in young people 18 years and under with stable asthma of any severity. however whether swimming is better than other forms of physical activity cannot be determined from this review. further adequately powered trials with longer follow-up periods are needed to better assess the long-term benefits of swimming.,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of swimming in children with asthma. further research is needed to determine whether swimming is associated with a significant improvement in asthma symptoms and quality of life in children., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of swimming as an intervention for asthma in children and adolescents with moderate asthma. there is a need for well-designed trials to evaluate the effects of swimming interventions on asthma outcomes in children with moderate and severe asthma and to investigate the effectiveness of other types of swim interventions for children with asthma with moderate to severe asthma.
374,we conclude that there is no evidence of difference between rhcg or rhlh and uhcg in achieving final follicular maturation in ivf with equivalent pregnancy rates and ohss incidence. according to these findings uhcg is still the best choice for final oocyte maturation triggering in ivf and icsi treatment cycles.,there is insufficient evidence to support the use of recombinant human chorionic gonadotropin for assisted reproduction., there is insufficient evidence to support the use of u-hcg for women undergoing assisted reproduction. there are insufficient data to support its use as an oocyte preparation technique. there is a need for further well-designed rcts to determine the optimal dose and duration of hcg in women undergoing ivf and to assess the safety of the same dose of progesterone for women with icsi and to determine whether the use is associated with increased risk of adverse events.
375,the use of ergometrine-oxytocin as part of the routine active management of the third stage of labour appears to be associated with a small but statistically significant reduction in the risk of pph when compared to oxytocin for blood loss of 500 ml or more. no statistically significant difference was observed between the groups for blood loss of 1000 ml or more. a statistically significant difference was observed in the presence of maternal side-effects including elevation of diastolic blood pressure vomiting and nausea associated with ergometrine-oxytocin use compared to oxytocin use. thus the advantage of a reduction in the risk of pph between 500 and 1000 ml blood loss needs to be weighed against the adverse side-effects associated with the use of ergometrine-oxytocin.,there is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of oxytocin alone for the prevention of postpartum haemorrhage., oxytocin and syntometrine are effective in preventing postpartum haemorrhage in the united arab emirates but there is insufficient evidence to support their use as an add-on treatment for women with severe hypertension or systolic blood pressure. the available evidence does not support the routine use of oxytocins or oxytocic in the treatment of women with elevated blood pressure or hystolic and diastolic blood pressures.
376,a significant health disparity exists whereby indigenous populations a minority are over-represented in the burden of smoking-related morbidity and mortality. this review highlights the paucity of evidence available to evaluate the effectiveness of smoking cessation interventions despite the known success of these interventions in non-indigenous populations. due to this lack of published investigations the external validity of this review is limited as is the ability to draw reliable conclusions from the results. the limited but available evidence reported does indicate that smoking cessation interventions specifically targeted at indigenous populations can produce smoking abstinence. however this evidence base is not strong with a small number of methodologically sound trials investigating these interventions. more rigorous trials are now required to assist in bridging the gap between tobacco related health disparities in indigenous and non-indigenous populations.,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of nicotine patches for smoking cessation in indigenous populations., smoking cessation strategies are effective in reducing smoking cessation rates in smokers. however the evidence is insufficient to make any recommendations about the most effective interventions for smoking cessation. the results of this review suggest that there is insufficient evidence to support the routine use of smoking cessation interventions for smokers in the usa. future research should focus on improving the quality of life of smokers and on reducing the incidence of quit intentions.
377,chemotherapy led to a small but significant benefit for overall survival and event-free survival. this benefit was essentially observed when chemotherapy was administered concomitantly with radiotherapy.,there is insufficient evidence to support the use of radiotherapy alone in the treatment of advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma., there is currently insufficient evidence to support the use of chemoradiotherapy as a monotherapy for nasopharyngeal carcinoma in patients with npc. there is no evidence to suggest that the combination chemotherapy is superior to radiotherapy alone in terms of overall survival or progression free survival in npc patients. however there is a need for further well-designed rcts to determine the optimal combination chemotherapy for npc in selected patients. these studies should be conducted in endemic areas.
378,there was a small reduction in the length of the third stage of labour and also in the amount of blood loss when cord drainage was applied compared with no cord drainage. the clinical importance of such observed statistically significant reductions is open to debate. there is no clear difference in the need for manual removal of placenta blood transfusion or the risk of postpartum haemorrhage. due to small trials with medium risk of bias the results should be interpreted with caution.,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of placental cord drainage for vaginal delivery. further research is needed to determine the optimal method of drainage for placental delivery., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of any of the methods used to prevent postpartum hemorrhage in normal placentas. further trials are needed to determine the effectiveness of the various methods used in this condition. note the four citations in the awaiting classification section of the review may alter the conclusions of the reviewed review once assessed. the review will no longer be updated.
379,long-acting beta-2 agonists particularly salmeterol are more effective than theophylline in improving morning and evening pef but are not significantly different in their effect on fev1. there is evidence of decreased daytime and nighttime short-acting beta-2 agonist requirement with salmeterol. fewer adverse events occurred in participants using long-acting beta-2 agonists salmeterol and formoterol as compared to theophylline.,there is insufficient evidence to support the use of theophylline in the treatment of nocturnal asthma., theophylline is more effective than nocturnal inhaled monchodilator therapy for reducing noctcturnal symptoms in moderate to severe asthma but there is insufficient evidence to support its use as an alternative to regular bronchodils in patients with asthma. there is a need for more well-designed controlled trials with adequate follow-up to assess the efficacy and safety of inhaled corticosteroids for patients with mild to moderate asthma.
380,we found insufficient evidence to determine if overground physical therapy gait training benefits gait function in patients with chronic stroke though limited evidence suggests small benefits for uni-dimensional variables such as gait speed or 6mwt. these findings must be replicated by large high quality studies using varied outcome measures.,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of task-orientated physical therapy in people with chronic stroke., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the effectiveness of physiotherapy for people with chronic obstructive disease following chronic stroke. there is a need for well-designed and reported trials to evaluate physiotherapy as an intervention for people who are at risk of disability after chronic stroke and to evaluate its effectiveness in people with long-term mobility problems. future trials should focus on improving the quality of life of people with mild obstructive diseases and on improving functional outcomes.
381,if we assume that screening reduces breast cancer mortality by 15 and that overdiagnosis and overtreatment is at 30 it means that for every 2000 women invited for screening throughout 10 years one will avoid dying of breast cancer and 10 healthy women who would not have been diagnosed if there had not been screening will be treated unnecessarily. furthermore more than 200 women will experience important psychological distress including anxiety and uncertainty for years because of false positive findings. to help ensure that the women are fully informed before they decide whether or not to attend screening we have written an evidence-based leaflet for lay people that is available in several languages on www.cochrane.dk. because of substantial advances in treatment and greater breast cancer awareness since the trials were carried out it is likely that the absolute effect of screening today is smaller than in the trials. recent observational studies show more overdiagnosis than in the trials and very little or no reduction in the incidence of advanced cancers with screening.,there is insufficient evidence to support the use of mammography for early detection of breast cancer in women aged 50 to 59 years., mammographic screening for breast cancer reduces the risk of death in women aged 40-64 years but does not appear to reduce breast cancer-related morbidity. however there is insufficient evidence to support the use of mammography for screening of breast cancer in this age group. further research is required to determine whether mammography should be used as a first-line screening for women with breast cancer and to assess the effects of screening on breast-related mortality.
382,finding from this review suggests that pre-exposure prophylaxis with tdf alone or tdf-ftc reduces the risk of acquiring hiv in high-risk individuals including people in serodiscordant relationships men who have sex with men and other high risk men and women.,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of oral antiretroviral drugs for the prevention of hiv., oral antiretroviral drugs emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate are effective in reducing nausea and vomiting in people with sex with men. however there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of these drugs in the treatment of men who have sex with women. further research is needed to determine the optimal dose and duration of treatment and to assess the effects on adverse events.
383,the finding that healing rates can be higher for cases treated surgically as compared to those treated non-surgically at least in the short term is based on two rcts only. a single rct reported that in the medium to long term healing rates for the two procedures are very similar. there is currently scarce evidence for a sound decision making process among alternative treatments for the re-treatment of a periradicular pathosis. more well-designed rcts should be performed with follow up of at least 4 years and with a consistent sample size to detect a true difference in the long term between the outcomes of the two alternative treatments if any exist.,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of root canal treatment for apical periodontitis. there is a need for further research., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the routine use of root-end resection for nonhealing periradicular pathosis. there is a need for high quality randomised controlled trials to evaluate the effectiveness of root end resection in the treatment of prehealing surgery. such trials should be conducted in low-income countries with low risk of bias.
384,on the basis of one randomised clinical trial with high risk of bias there is insufficient evidence to conclude if in patients with liver metastases from various primary sites cryotherapy brings any significant benefit in terms of survival or recurrence compared with conventional surgery. in addition there is no evidence for the effectiveness of cryotherapy when compared with no intervention. at present cryotherapy cannot be recommended outside randomised clinical trials.,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of cryosurgical techniques in the treatment of cancer., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of cryogenic and conventional surgery for lm. however there is a need for well-designed adequately powered randomised controlled trials to evaluate the efficacy and safety of these interventions. such trials should be conducted in low-income countries with low incidence of lm and should be powered to detect clinically important differences in outcome.
385,with an overall high grade of evidence this review revealed an improvement of clinical results acr50 28 joint disease activity score das-28 remission and haq scores with certolizumab pegol. adverse events were more frequent with certolizumab there was a statistically significant increase in the number of serious adverse events infections and hypertension.,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of cdp870 for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of hydrogel infusion for rheumatoid arthritis. there is a need for further well-designed and reported rcts to evaluate the effectiveness of this intervention for the treatment of ra. these trials should be conducted in the context of well designed and well-controlled rheumatic arthritis trials.
386,active chest compression-decompression in patients with cardiac arrest is not associated with clear benefit.,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of compression-decompression cardiopulmonary resuscitation in the treatment of patients with prehospital cardiac arrest., active compression-decompression cardiopulmonary resuscitation is associated with a reduction in the risk of neurological outcome in patients who had cardiac arrest outside the hospital but no reduction in neurological outcome was found in patients receiving cpr. there is insufficient evidence to support the use of this technique as a first-line treatment for cardiac arrest in people who have nonraumatic cardiac arrest. there are insufficient data to support its use as a second-line technique for patients who have cardiac arrest within the hospital.
387,there is insufficient evidence of efficacy of individual antioxidants or antioxidants in general in the treatment of people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. one study reported a mild positive effect but this was not supported in our analysis. if future trials of antioxidant medications are performed careful attention should be given to sample size outcome measures and duration of the trials. the high tolerance and safety and relatively low cost of vitamins c and e explain the continuing use of these vitamins by physicians and people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. while there is no substantial clinical trial evidence to support their clinical use there is no clear contraindication.,there is insufficient evidence to support the use of anticoagulants in the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of antioxidant supplements for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. however there is a need for further well-designed controlled trials to determine whether antioxidant supplements are effective in amyotroph sclerosis and whether they are safe and effective in the management of this condition. there is no evidence to suggest that antioxidant supplements should be used as first-line treatment for als or other types of als.
388,there is insufficient evidence to determine possible advantages or disadvantages of immediate immediate-delayed or delayed implants therefore these preliminary conclusions are based on few underpowered trials often judged to be at high risk of bias. there is a suggestion that immediate and immediate-delayed implants may be at higher risks of implant failures and complications than delayed implants on the other hand the aesthetic outcome might be better when placing implants just after teeth extraction. there is not enough reliable evidence supporting or refuting the need for augmentation procedures at immediate implants placed in fresh extraction sockets or whether any of the augmentation techniques is superior to the others.,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of implants in the removal of teeth. further randomised controlled trials are needed to confirm the effectiveness and safety of implants for removing teeth., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of elective implants for mucosal implants in periapical cultures. there is a need for further well-designed trials to determine the optimal type of implant for this condition. future trials should focus on improving the quality of life of patients and on improving bone healing in the upper arch.
389,given that only three rcts were included in this systematic review and the high risk of bias in two of the three studies there is insufficient evidence to either support or refute the use of lycopene for the prevention of prostate cancer. similarly there is no robust evidence from rcts to identify the impact of lycopene consumption upon the incidence of prostate cancer prostate symptoms psa levels or adverse events.,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of lycopene in the treatment of prostate hyperplasia., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the routine use of lycopene supplementation for the treatment of bph. further trials are needed to confirm the efficacy and safety profiles of these supplements in men with elevated bph and to determine whether they are effective in preventing bph progression in patients with elevated prostate hyperplasia. these trials should be powered to detect clinically important adverse effects such as increased serum psa levels and psa-levels.
390,of the four studies identified one had low and three an unclear risk of bias. there is insufficient evidence from randomized controlled trials to show significant benefit from non-antiepileptic drugs in trigeminal neuralgia. more research is needed.,there is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of ophthalmic anesthetic eyedrops for the treatment of trigeminal neuralgia., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of topical eyedrops for trigeminal neuralgia in the treatment of trigemina oxytocaine. there is a need for further well-designed and reported randomised controlled trials to evaluate the efficacy and safety of these drugs in trigemine neuralgias. these trials should be powered to detect clinically important differences in efficacy between these drugs.
391,in elective liver resection hepatic vascular occlusion cannot be recommended over portal triad clamping. intermittent portal triad clamping seems to be better than continuous portal triad clamping at least in patients with chronic liver disease. there is no evidence to support selective inflow occlusion over portal triad clamping. the optimal method of intermittent portal triad clamping is not clear. there is no evidence for any difference between the ischaemic preconditioning followed by vascular occlusion and intermittent vascular occlusion for liver resection in patients with non-cirrhotic livers. further randomised trials of low risk of bias are needed to determine the optimal technique of vascular occlusion.,there is insufficient evidence to support the use of continuous portal clamping for liver resections in cirrhotic patients undergoing hepatectomy., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of cio for liver resections in patients with cirrhosis. there is no evidence that cio is more effective than intermittent clamping in patients who are not cirrhotic. there are no studies comparing cio with continuous clamping and intermittent looping for hepatectomy in patients undergoing liver transection. there was no evidence of a difference between cio versus intermittent loop clamping for patients with normal liver parenchyma.
392,the most likely effective treatment to slow myopia progression thus far is anti-muscarinic topical medication. however side effects of these medications include light sensitivity and near blur. also they are not yet commercially available so their use is limited and not practical. further information is required for other methods of myopia control such as the use of corneal reshaping contact lenses or bifocal soft contact lenses bscls with a distance center are promising but currently no published randomized clinical trials exist.,the is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of pirenzepine for the prevention of myopia in children., pirenzepine monocals are effective in reducing myopic progression in children with a small amount of myopia but are associated with a decrease in myopia progression and a decreased risk of developing myopia. no adverse events were reported in the included studies. no studies were found to have a significant effect on myopia in children who were not treated with monocoals. no study was found to be associated with an increase in the risk of severe myopia when wearing monocoal or monocal retinal myopia and no studies reported on adverse events in children treated with bifocals or monocoAL retinal retinal or ocular biocals.
393,despite identifying 34 trials related to treatments for blepharitis there is no strong evidence for any of the treatments in terms of curing chronic blepharitis. commercial products are marketed to consumers and prescribed to patients without substantial evidence of effectiveness. further research is needed to evaluate the effectiveness of such treatments. any rct designed for this purpose should separate participants by type of condition e.g. staphylococcal blepharitis or mgd in order to minimize imbalances between groups type i errors and to achieve statistical power for analyses prevent type ii errors). medical interventions and commercial products should be compared with conventional lid hygiene measures such as warm compresses and eyelid margin washing to determine effectiveness as well as head-to-head to show comparative effectiveness between treatments. outcomes of interest should be patient-centered and measured using validated questionnaires or scales. it is important that participants be followed long-term at least one year to assess chronic outcomes properly.,there is insufficient evidence to support the use of topical ophthalmic ointments for the treatment of meibomian gland dysfunction., ocular ointment is effective in reducing blepharitis and associated rosacea and reduces the number of meibomian gland inclusions in the control eye. there is insufficient evidence to support the use of topical ointments in the treatment of blepharmaritis or blepharaoconjunctivitis. there are insufficient data to support a recommendation for the routine use of ocular oxy-3 ointents in the management of patients with ocular disease. the current evidence is insufficient to support any recommendation for topical ocular orgahexa ocular/oxy-2 ointants for the prevention of bacterial-free bacterial infections in patients with meibomonous ocular diseases.
394,terbutaline pump maintenance therapy has not been shown to decrease the risk of preterm birth by prolonging pregnancy. furthermore the lack of information on the safety of the therapy as well as its substantial expense argues against its role in the management of arrested preterm labor. future use should only be in the context of well-conducted adequately powered randomized controlled trials. note the two citations in the awaiting classification section of the review may alter the conclusions of the review once assessed.,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of intravenous magnesium sulfate tocolysis for preterm delivery., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of hydrocortisone to prevent preterm delivery in preterm women with suspected preterm labour. there is a need for further trials to investigate the effectiveness of this intervention in preventing preterm birth in women who have uterine contractions with normal saline solution and to determine the optimal dose and route of administration for women who continue to labour with intravenous magnesium.
395,at the moment there is no evidence from individual rcts in children and adults with different malignancies that underscores the use of an lbd for the prevention of infection and related outcomes. all studies differed with regard to co-interventions outcome definitions and intervention and control diets. since pooling of results was not possible and all studies had serious methodological limitations no definitive conclusions can be made. it should be noted that no evidence of effect as identified in this review is not the same as evidence of no effect'. based on the currently available evidence we are not able to give recommendations for clinical practice. more high-quality research is needed.,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of a low-bacterial diet for patients with acute myeloid leukemia., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of antimicrobial prophylaxis for people with cytopenia or ameloid leukemia. there is a need for well-designed randomised controlled trials to evaluate the effects of antimicrobials on mortality and morbidity in people with aml. these trials should be conducted in high-quality settings with adequate follow-up.
396,oxygen can relieve dyspnoea in mildly and non-hypoxaemic people with copd who would not otherwise qualify for home oxygen therapy. given the significant heterogeneity among the included studies clinicians should continue to evaluate patients on an individual basis until supporting data from ongoing large randomised controlled trials are available.,the is insufficient evidence to support the use of short-term oxygen supplementation in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease., oxygen supplementation during moderate-maximal exercise reduces oxygen in one second fev1 in patients with hypoxaemia and hyppnoea but does not appear to be associated with increased hyperinflation. oxygen supplementation is associated with a reduction in hyperoxa and a decrease in breathlessness in people with hypoxic copd and does not seem to have a clinically important effect on mortality or morbidity.
397,there was insufficient robust evidence from randomised trials to establish the relative effectiveness of different methods of anaesthesia different associated physical techniques or the use of drug adjuncts in the treatment of distal radial fractures. there is however some indication that haematoma block provides poorer analgesia than ivra and can compromise reduction. given the many unresolved questions over the management of these fractures we suggest an integrated programme of research which includes consideration of anaesthesia options is the way forward.,there is insufficient evidence to support the use of intravenous anaesthetic techniques for the treatment of distal radius fractures., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of bier's block over haematoma block for the treatment of distal radius fractures in adults. there is no evidence to suggest that bier-block is superior to other block types for the management of acute distal fracture. there are insufficient data to determine whether bier blocks should be used for the prevention of acute fractures in adult patients with distal and closed fractures. further trials are required to determine the optimal block type for acute fractures.
398,complications for surgical first trimester abortion are rare. the included studies do not indicate overall benefits of one over the other method. mva can be used for early first trimester surgical abortion but maybe more difficult when used later in the first trimester. duration of procedure is shorter with va compared to d&c which may be of importance when using local anaesthetics or for busy clinics. outcomes such as women's satisfaction the need for pain relief or surgeons preference for the instrument have been inadequately addressed. no long-term outcomes such as fertility after surgical abortion are available.,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of manual vacuum aspiration for abortion at less than 10 weeks gestation., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the routine use of manual vacuum aspiration for first trimester abortion in women with pre-eclampsia. there is a need for more high quality randomised controlled trials with adequate follow-up to determine the optimal method for first-trimester abortions in women who are pregnant. the current evidence is insufficient to recommend the use of any particular method for this purpose. further research is required to determine which methods are the most effective and safe methods for this procedure.
399,the trial provided some weak and unreliable evidence that there was no significant difference in the effectiveness of minimal incision palatopharyngoplasty versus the same procedure performed simultaneously with an individually tailored pharyngeal flap or sphincter pharyngoplasty for correcting velopharyngeal insufficiency associated with submucous cleft palate.,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of oral surgery for the occlusion of the velopharyngeal sphincter., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the routine use of velopharyngeal insufficiency in submucous cleft palate. however there is a need for further well-designed placebo-controlled trials to evaluate the efficacy and safety of this intervention. such trials should be conducted in the context of well designed and reported clinical trials to assess the effectiveness of interventions to improve outcomes.
400,in patients with good-grade aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage intraoperative mild hypothermia might prevent death or dependency in activities of daily living for a few of them. however the confidence intervals include the possibility of both benefit and harm. there is no evidence that intraoperative mild hypothermia is harmful. this treatment should not be routinely applied. in patients with poor-grade aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage or without subarachnoid haemorrhage there are insufficient data to draw any conclusions. a high-quality randomised clinical trial of intraoperative mild hypothermia for postoperative neurological deficits in patients with poor-grade aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage might be feasible.,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of hypothermia in the treatment of acute aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of hypothermia for cerebral aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage. however there is a need for well-designed randomised controlled trials with adequate follow-up to determine the optimal treatment for this condition. such trials should be conducted in high-grade patients with a preoperative history of severe subarachynoids and should be powered to detect clinically important outcomes.
401,although numerous studies have been undertaken there is a noticeable inconsistency of the findings of the available studies and this is confounded by serious methodological issues within the included studies. the body of evidence in this review does not support the hypothesis that multi-component community wide interventions effectively increase population levels of physical activity. there is a clear need for well-designed intervention studies and such studies should focus on the quality of the measurement of physical activity the frequency of measurement and the allocation to intervention and control communities.,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of community-based physical activity interventions in the prevention of cardiovascular disease., community-based interventions are effective in reducing physical activity in people aged 18 to 65 years living in deprived neighbourhoods. there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the effectiveness of community interventions in improving physical activity and reducing weight gain in those aged 18-65 years living within deprived neighbourhoods in arkansas and tennessee. there are insufficient data to support the effectiveness and safety of community- based interventions in reducing weight and improving physical activities in these communities.
402,use of either doxycycline 200 mg or azithromycin 500 mg by mouth before iud insertion confers little benefit. while the reduction in unscheduled visits to the provider was marginally significant the cost-effectiveness of routine prophylaxis remains questionable. a uniform finding in these trials was the low risk of iud-associated infection with or without use of antibiotic prophylaxis.,there is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of prophylactic antibiotics prior to iud insertion for women with iud infection., prophylactic antibiotics doxycycline and azithromycin are effective in preventing iud-related pelvic infection in women with low risk of iud infection. however there is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of these antibiotics as an effective treatment for women with lower risk of infection. further research is required to determine the optimal antibiotic regimen for women who do not have an iud or low-risk of iuds infection.
403,we found no reason to change current treatment recommendations. however considerable uncertainty continues to exist about the optimal schedule for desferrioxamine in people with transfusion-dependent thalassaemia.,there is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of deferiprone for thalassemia major. further trials are needed to determine the optimal dose of the treatment., desferriamine and deferiprone are equally effective in thalassemia major and serum ferritin levels. however there is insufficient evidence to support or refute their use as an alternative to desferritin. the available evidence is insufficient to support the use of these agents as a first-line treatment for thalassaemia major. further trials are required to confirm the effectiveness of desferridin as a second-line therapy for thalaassemia.
404,the findings of this review indicate that the number of systemic and topical drugs used for the different subforms of pruritus is increasing. different interventions have been shown to be effective in the treatment of pruritus of different origins. nevertheless an optimal therapy for pruritus is constrained due to the limited understanding of crucial itch mediators and receptors in the various subforms of itch. ideal antipruritic therapies are still lacking especially for palliative care patients. this systematic review also indicates that there is insufficient evidence to give any concrete recommendations regarding treatment of pruritus in palliative care patients. due to the very small sample sizes and poor methodological quality of the majority of studies that were included the results of this review need to be interpreted with caution. furthermore the generalizability is questionable. additional studies and particularly carefully designed treatment trials are needed to provide valid evidence for adequate treatment of pruritus in palliative care patients.,there is insufficient evidence to support the use of topical corticosteroids for the treatment of pruritus., there is insufficient evidence to support the use of punchline-effect as an effective treatment for pruritus in patients with cholestasis. there is no evidence to suggest that pbc is effective in treating pruris in patients treated with erythropoietin or rifampin for treating patients with uremia and pbc in patients who are unable to tolerate pbc due to the lack of evidence in the included studies.
405,this review found a beneficial effect of banding ligation on primary prevention of upper gastrointestinal bleeding in patient with oesophageal varices. the effect on bleeding did not reduce mortality. additional evidence is needed to determine whether our results reflect that non-selective beta-blockers have other beneficial effects than on bleeding.,there is insufficient evidence to support the use of endoscopic variceal band ligation in the treatment of cirrhosis of the liver. there is a need for more well-designed randomised controlled trials., endoscopic variceal ligation is an effective method for reducing resting pulse in patients with high-risk esophageal varices but there is no evidence to support the use of propranolol in patients at high risk of bleeding in cirrhosis. there is insufficient evidence to determine the optimal prophylaxis for patients with low-risk varices. there are no studies available to assess the optimal treatment method for patients who are at increased risk for bleeding.
406,results of this review do not provide sufficient evidence in favour of anticonvulsants for the treatment of aws. there are some suggestions that carbamazepine may actually be more effective in treating some aspects of alcohol withdrawal when compared to benzodiazepines the current first-line regimen for alcohol withdrawal syndrome. anticonvulsants seem to have limited side effects although adverse effects are not rigorously reported in the analysed trials.,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of carbamazepine in the treatment of alcohol withdrawal., there is insufficient evidence to support the use of benzodiazepines for the treatment of alcohol withdrawal symptoms in patients who are unable to withdraw from alcohol withdrawal due to a lack of studies. there is no evidence that any of the other anticonvulsants are effective in reducing withdrawal symptoms and reducing the need for additional medication in patients with an alcohol withdrawal syndrome.
407,a large number of studies appear to address the research questions but few are of sufficient quality to be reliable. available evidence does suggest these substances are better than placebo at alleviating depression. further studies are needed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 5-htp and tryptophan before their widespread use can be recommended. the possible association between these substances and the potentially fatal eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome has not been elucidated. because alternative antidepressants exist which have been proven to be effective and safe the clinical usefulness of 5-htp and tryptophan is limited at present.,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of amitriptyline in the treatment of depression., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of amitriptyline as an add-on treatment for the treatment of pre-existing premenstrual conditions. further research is needed to determine the optimal combination and combination therapy for pre-menstruals and to determine its role in the management of postmenstruative conditions such as postmenopausal complications.
408,information on all comparisons are of limited quality are incomplete and problematic to apply clinically. aripiprazole is an antipsychotic drug with a variant but not absent adverse effect profile. long-term data are sparse and there is considerable scope for another update of this review as new data emerges from the many chinese studies as well as from ongoing larger independent pragmatic trials.,there is insufficient evidence to support the use of olanzapine for the treatment of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder., aripiprazole is an effective antipsychotic medication for schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorders. however there is insufficient evidence to support its use as an effective treatment for schizophrenia or schizoective disorder. there is a need for further well-designed trials to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability profiles of this drug in people with schizophrenia and other schizosuppective disorders and to evaluate its safety profile in comparison to other drugs such as other drugs.
409,there is no evidence to support the use of vaginal chlorhexidine during labour in preventing maternal and neonatal infections. there is a need for a well-designed randomized controlled trial using appropriate concentration and volume of vaginal chlorhexidine irrigation solution and with adequate sample size.,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of chlorhexidine vaginal irrigation for the prevention of peripartal infection in women in labour., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of chlorhexidine for the prevention of peripartal infection in labour. there is a need for well-designed randomised controlled trials with adequate follow-up to assess the effects of this intervention on the prevention and treatment of preterm birth. note the four citations in the awaiting classification section ofthe review may alter the conclusions of the review once assessed. the review will no longer be updated.
410,the low to very low quality of the evidence of studies included in this review provides insufficient evidence to determine with certainty which interventions are most effective in changing professional behaviour and in what contexts. however interventions that may be worth further study are educational interventions involving more than one active element and that are repeatedly administered over time and interventions employing specialised personnel who are focused on an aspect of care that is supported by evidence e.g. dentists/dental auxiliaries performing oral care for vap prevention.,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of central venous catheters for ventilator-associated pneumonia., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the effectiveness of educational interventions for ventilator-associated pneumonia in clinical settings. however there is evidence that educational interventions are effective in reducing pneumonia rates in outpatient care settings. there is also evidence that education interventions may be effective in decreasing pneumonia rates when used as part of a surgical intensive care protocol. however the evidence is limited by the small number of studies included in this review and the small sample sizes of the studies.
411,in those clinical settings where surgical expertise and equipment are available and affordable diagnostic laparoscopy and la either in combination or separately seem to have various advantages over oa. some of the clinical effects of la however are small and of limited clinical relevance. in spite of the mediocre quality of the available research data we would generally recommend to use laparoscopy and la in patients with suspected appendicitis unless laparoscopy itself is contraindicated or not feasible. especially young female obese and employed patients seem to benefit from la.,there laparoscopic appendectomy is more effective than open appendectomy in reducing the risk of acute appendicitis. however there is insufficient evidence to support the use of laparoscopy as an alternative to open surgery., laparoscopic appendectomy does not appear to be associated with a reduction in the need for analgesia and the time to return to normal activities when laparoscopy is associated with an increase in wound infections and a decrease in the length of stay in the hospital for women and the need of analgesia for reducing wound infections in women and no reduction in postoperative complications in women with acute appendicitis<sep<interventions are associated with increased wound infection and a decreased length of hospital stay for women with a decreased rate of sick leave for women. no reduction was found in the cost of women with an increased rate of wound infections but no reduction between women and men with a reduced rate of no reduction for the cost.
412,sargramostim does not appear to be more effective than placebo for induction of clinical remission or clinical improvement in patients with active crohn's disease. however the grade analysis indicates that the overall quality of the evidence for the primary clinical remission and secondary outcomes clinical response was low indicating that further research is likely to have an impact on the effect estimates.,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of sargramostim in the treatment of active crohn's disease., sargramostim was more effective than placebo for inducing remission in crohn's disease. however the evidence is insufficient to recommend its use as an adjunctive treatment for crohn´s disease. further trials are needed to determine the optimal dose and duration of treatment for patients with crohn`s disease with corticosteroid dependence and to assess the efficacy of other agents.
413,from the available evidence we cannot determine whether or not preoperative analgesics are of benefit in paediatric dentistry for procedures under local anaesthetic. there is probably a benefit in prescribing preoperative analgesics prior to orthodontic separator placement.,the is insufficient evidence to support the use of preoperative analgesics for orthodontic separator placement., ibuprofen given orally 1 hour before separator placement is effective in reducing post-extraction pain in children with moderate to severe pain associated with primary mandibular molar tooth extraction. the evidence is limited by the small number of studies included in this review and the small sample sizes of the included studies. further research is required to determine the optimal dose and duration of administration for post-operative ibupsrofen in children and adults.
414,antibiotic prophylaxis in afebrile neutropenic patients significantly reduced all-cause mortality. in our review the most significant reduction in mortality was observed in trials assessing prophylaxis with quinolones. the benefits of antibiotic prophylaxis outweighed the harm such as adverse effects and the development of resistance since all-cause mortality was reduced. as most trials in our review were of patients with haematologic cancer we strongly recommend antibiotic prophylaxis for these patients preferably with a quinolone. prophylaxis may also be considered for patients with solid tumours or lymphoma.,there is insufficient evidence to support the use of oral antibiotics in patients with acute leukemia undergoing chemotherapy. further trials are needed to determine whether oral antibiotics are effective in treating acute leukemia., there is insufficient evidence to support the use of antimicrobial prophylaxis for neutropenia in patients who are at increased risk for gramulocytopenia and/or mortality. there are insufficient data to support a reduction in all-cause mortality in patients receiving antineoplastic therapy for patients with nebrile episodes.<interventions are not supported by the available evidence.
415,calcium supplementation is associated with a significant protective benefit in the prevention of pre-eclampsia and should be used for this indication according to a previous review. this review indicates that there are no additional benefits for calcium supplementation in prevention of preterm birth or low infant birth weight. while there was a statistically significant difference of 80 g identified in mean infant birth weight there was significant heterogeneity identified and the clinical significance of this difference is uncertain.,there calcium supplementation appears to reduce the risk of pregnancy-induced hypertension in women with pre-eclampsia. however there is insufficient evidence to determine whether calcium supplementation is associated with a reduction in preterm birth., calcium supplementation during pregnancy reduces the risk of pre-eclampsia and preterm birth but there is insufficient evidence to support the use of calcium supplementation in women with pre-existing hypertension. calcium supplementation is associated with a reduction in the rate of pregnancy-induced hypertension but there are insufficient data to support its use in women at high risk of pregnancy. calcium supplements should not be used for women with elevated blood pressure or to reduce the risk for pre-embraternal and neonatal outcomes. there is no evidence to recommend calcium supplementation for women at increased risk of hypertension or preterm births.
416,dietitians were better than doctors at lowering blood cholesterol in the short to medium term but there was no evidence that they were better than self-help resources. there was no evidence that dietitians provided better outcomes than nurses.the results should be interpreted with caution as the studies were not of good quality and the analysis was based on a limited number of trials.,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of dietary interventions for people with hypercholesterolaemia., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of dietary interventions to prevent type iv hypercholesterolemia in people with normal body weight. there is a need for further well-designed controlled trials to investigate the effects of dietary intervention on type iv disease and to evaluate the effects on type ii hypercholesterol in people who are at increased risk of developing non-diet-dependent diabetes with no-treatment.
417,the review suggests a substantial caries-inhibiting effect of fluoride varnish in both the permanent and the deciduous dentitions based largely on trials with no treatment controls. there is little information concerning acceptability of treatment or possible side effects in the included trials. given the relatively poor quality of most of the included studies and the wide confidence intervals around the estimates of effect there remains a need for further trials. it is important that these trials should be of high quality and include assessment of potential adverse effects.,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of fluoride varnish for the prevention of caries., fluoride varnishes are effective in reducing caries progression in permanent first molars but there is insufficient evidence to support their use as an adjunct to other types of caries reduction in adults and children. there is no evidence to suggest that they are effective as a substitute for other forms of oral caries in adults or children. the current available evidence is insufficient to support the use of any type of fluoride for this purpose. future research should focus on improving the quality of life in children and adults.
418,stapled hemorrhoidopexy is associated with a higher long-term risk of hemorrhoid recurrence and the symptom of prolapse. it is also associated with a higher likelihood of long-term symptom recurrence and the need for additional operations compared to conventional excisional hemorrhoid surgeries. patients should be informed of these risks when being offered the stapled hemorrhoidopexy as surgical therapy. if hemorrhoid recurrence and prolapse are the most important clinical outcomes then conventional excisional surgery remains the gold standard in the surgical treatment of internal hemorrhoids.,there is insufficient evidence to support the use of stapled haemorrhoidectomy in the treatment of hemorrhoids. further trials are needed., there is insufficient evidence to support the use of stapled haemorrhoidectomy for hemorrhoidectomy in the treatment of haemsorrhoids in patients with hemorrhoids grade iii and iv hemorrhoids. there is no evidence to suggest that stapling haemodectomy is superior to excision hemorrhoids for the management of hemorrhoids in terms of postoperative pain and reduction in postoperative complications and a reduced hospital stay. there are no studies available for other types of hemorrhoidalectomy.
419,although there are shortcomings and gaps in the data there appears to be enough overall consistency for different outcomes. the efficacy and adverse effects profile of penfluridol are similar to other typical antipsychotics both oral and depot. furthermore penfluridol is shown to be an adequate treatment option for people with schizophrenia especially those who do not respond to oral medication on a daily basis and do not adapt well to depot drugs. one of the results favouring penfluridol was a lower drop out rate in medium term when compared to depot medications. it is also an option for chronic sufferers of schizophrenia with residual psychotic symptoms who nevertheless need continuous use of antipsychotic medication. an additional benefit of penfluridol is that it is a low-cost intervention. note the eight citations in the awaiting classification section of the review may alter the conclusions of the review once assessed.,there is insufficient evidence to support the use of penfluridol for the maintenance of schizophrenia., penfluridol and trifluoperazine are effective in treating schizophrenia but there is insufficient evidence to make any recommendations for clinical practice. we recommend that future trials should be of high methodological quality and report on the effects of these drugs on people with schizophrenia. we suggest that future research should focus on improving the quality of life of patients with schizophrenia and on the treatment of people with schizoaffective disorders.
420,the body of evidence summarised in this review is insufficient to allow any conclusion to be drawn about the use of pharmacological interventions in the treatment of antisocial personality disorder.,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of phenytoin for the treatment of impulsive aggression in alcoholics., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of anticonvulsants for the treatment of impulsive aggression in cluster b personality disorders. there is a need for further well-designed and reported trials to evaluate the efficacy of these agents for treating impulsive aggressive aggression in people with comorbid psychiatric disorders. these trials should be conducted in the context of well-defined subtypes of psychophysiological disorders.
421,on the basis of one randomised trial which did not describe its methodology in sufficient detail to assess risk of bias and quality excluded 27 of patients after randomisation due to various reasons and is probably not free from selective outcome reporting bias there is insufficient evidence to conclude that in patients with colonic cancer liver metastases electro-coagulation alone brings any significant benefit in terms of survival or recurrence compared with the control. in addition there is insufficient evidence for the effectiveness of adding allopurinol or dimethyl sulphoxide to electro-coagulation. the probability for selective outcome reporting bias in the trial is high. more randomised trials are needed in order to sufficiently validate electro-coagulation with or without co-interventions.,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of allopurinol in the treatment of colonic cancer., palliative sigmoid colectomy for advanced colonic cancer does not appear to be effective in reducing the incidence of adverse events in patients with advanced tumours. however there is insufficient evidence to recommend its use as an effective treatment for advanced tumouric cancer. further trials are needed to determine the effectiveness of this intervention in improving the quality of life of patients with cancer.
422,ivig administration results in a 3 reduction in sepsis and a 4 reduction in one or more episodes of any serious infection but is not associated with reductions in other clinically important outcomes including mortality. prophylactic use of ivig is not associated with any short-term serious side effects. the decision to use prophylactic ivig will depend on the costs and the values assigned to the clinical outcomes. there is no justification for conducting additional rcts to test the efficacy of previously studied ivig preparations in reducing nosocomial infections in preterm and/or lbw infants.,there is insufficient evidence to support the use of intravenous immunoglobulin in preterm infants with sepsis., there is insufficient evidence to support the routine use of ivig in preterm preterm infants with very low birth weight infants. there is no evidence that ivig is effective in preventing sepsis. there are insufficient studies to determine whether ivig should be used as a prophylaxis for preterm neonates with low birthweight infants. no studies have been identified to determine the risk of sepis in high-risk neonates.
423,choice of therapy for second stage gambiense hat will continue to be determined by what is locally available but eflornithine and nect are likely to replace melarsoprol with careful parasite resistance monitoring. we need research on reducing adverse effects of currently used drugs testing different regimens and experimental and clinical studies of new compounds effective for both stages of the disease.,there is insufficient evidence to support the use of melarsoprol in the treatment of trypanosoma brucei gambiense. further trials are needed., there is insufficient evidence to support the use of melarsoprol for the treatment of trypanosomiasis in people with encephalopathy. there is a need for further trials to assess the efficacy and safety of combination therapy in people who are at risk for trypanotomiasis and to determine whether combination therapy is effective in treating people with ogganda.
424,in patients with stable copd pmdi produced similar outcomes to a dry powder device for delivering beta2-agonists but the very small number of studies and included patients does not permit firm conclusions to be drawn. the soft mist device for ipratropium was more effective than a pmdi but the data come from one small study. there need to be further well designed randomised controlled trials to define the role of inhaler devices using bronchodilators in stable copd.,there is insufficient evidence to support the use of dpi in the treatment of copd. further trials are needed to determine whether dpi is superior to dpi for copd and whether it is better than dpi or dpi., there is insufficient evidence to support the use of ratropium bromide as an inhaler for treating stable copd. there is a need for further well-designed controlled trials to evaluate the efficacy and safety of this intervention for copd and to compare the efficacy of other inhaled inhaled agents. such trials should be conducted in high-quality settings with adequate follow-up.
425,the main source of evidence for the current practice of laparoscopic excision of renal cancer is drawn from case series small retrospective studies and very few small randomised controlled trials. the results and conclusions of these studies must therefore be interpreted with caution.,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of laparoscopic radical nephrectomy for the prevention of hernia formation. further research is needed to determine the effectiveness of this approach for the management of the hernia., there is currently insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of any type of procedure for stage ct1-t2. there is a need for further well-designed and reported trials to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of different types of procedures for ct 1-t 2. these trials should be powered to detect clinically important differences in the risk of complications such as death and major complications.
426,based on evidence from only one high-bias risk trial it appears that early laparoscopic cholecystectomy less than 24 hours after diagnosis of biliary colic decreases the morbidity during the waiting period for elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy mean waiting time 4.2 months the hospital stay and operating time. further randomised clinical trials are necessary to confirm or refute these findings and to determine if early laparoscopic cholecystectomy is better than the delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy if the waiting time is shortened further.,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of open cholecystectomy for the treatment of biliary colic., preoperative laparoscopic cholecystectomy is not recommended for the treatment of biliary colic because of the lack of adequate follow-up and lack of reliable outcome measures. further research is required to determine the optimal treatment for patients with biliary mucic colic and to assess the optimal time-to-event ratio for these patients.
427,magnesium sulphate more than halves the risk of eclampsia and probably reduces maternal death. there is no clear effect on outcome after discharge from hospital. a quarter of women report side effects with magnesium sulphate.,there magnesium sulfate and phenytoin appear to reduce the risk of pre-eclampsia. however there is insufficient evidence to support the use of magnesium sulphate in women with preeclampia., there is insufficient evidence to support the routine use of magnesium sulphate for women with pre-eclampsia. however there is a need for further trials to determine whether magnesium sulphates should be used as an adjunct to other antiiconvulsant therapies for women who are pregnant with severe preeclampsias. there is no evidence to suggest that magnesium sulfate should be withheld from pregnant women with severe precephalampsia or who are not pregnant with mild preeclampia. further trials are required to determine the optimal dose and duration of labour for women to assess the effects on maternal and neonatal outcomes.
428,limited data on the effect of ß-interferon treatment on ppms exists. only two single-centre placebo controlled trials of interferon beta have been done. based on this review the included studies showed that ß-interferon treatment was not associated with reduced disability progression in ppms patients. however the trial population was too small to allow definitive conclusions on the efficacy of ß-interferon therapy in ppms patients. larger research studies need to be done in patients with ppms in order to clarify whether ß-interferon is effective in this population.,there is insufficient evidence to support the use of interferon beta-1a in the treatment of primary progressive ms., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of interferon beta-1b as an adjunctive therapy for primary progressive ms. further trials are needed to confirm the efficacy and safety of this intervention in the management of ms. these trials should be conducted in the context of well-designed placebo-controlled clinical trials with adequate sample sizes and adequate follow-up periods.
429,we found no evidence to support or refute antioxidant supplements in patients with liver disease. antioxidant supplements may increase liver enzyme activity.,there is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of vitamin e supplementation for the prevention of liver cirrhosis or liver cancer., there is insufficient evidence to support the routine use of antioxidant supplements for the treatment of hepatitis c in patients who are not responsive to alpha-interferon or positive for hcv. there is no evidence to suggest that antioxidant supplements are effective for the prevention of hbv infection in patients with severe hepatitis c. there are insufficient data to assess the effect of antioxidant supplementation on mortality in people with hepatitis c or positive hcv infection in people who are unable to tolerate alpha-tocopherol and/or positive hv infection.
430,there is currently insufficient evidence from which to draw firm conclusions about the impact of postoperative face-down positioning on the outcome of surgery for macular hole. of three rcts two suggested a benefit in larger holes but none demonstrated evidence of a benefit in smaller holes. consort adherent rcts and large scale well designed non-randomised observational studies are needed to determine with confidence the value of this intervention.,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of facedown positioning for vitrectomy after macular hole surgery., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the routine use of vitreoretinal surgery for macular hole surgery in idiopathic mular hole mh surgery. there is a need for high quality randomised controlled trials to determine the optimal position for this surgery. such trials should be conducted in the context of high quality randomized controlled trials with low risk of bias.
431,behavioral interventions reduce self-reported unprotected anal sex among msm. these results indicate that hiv prevention for this population can work and should be supported. results of previous studies provide a benchmark for expectations in new studies. meta-analysis can inform future design and implementation in terms of sample size target populations settings goals for process measures and intervention content. when effects differ by design variables which are deliberately selected and planned awareness of these characteristics may be beneficial to future designs. researchers designing future small group and individual-level studies should keep in mind that to date effects of the greatest magnitude have been observed in studies that used count outcomes and a shorter intervention span up to 1 month). among small group and individual-level studies effects were also greatest when the comparison condition included minimal to no hiv prevention content. nevertheless statistically significant favorable effects were also seen when the comparison condition included standard or other hiv prevention content. researchers choosing the latter option for new studies should plan for larger sample sizes based on the smaller expected net intervention effect noted above. when effects differ by implementation variables which become evident as the study is conducted but are not usually selected or planned caution may be advised so that future studies can reduce bias. because intervention effects were somewhat stronger though not statistically significantly so in studies with a greater attrition in the comparison condition differential retention may be a threat to validity. extra effort should be given to retaining participants in comparison conditions. among community-level interventions intervention effects were strongest among studies with random assignment of groups or communities. therefore the inclusion of studies where assignment of groups or communities was by convenience did not exaggerate the summary effect. the greater effectiveness of interventions including more than 25 non-gay identifying msm suggests that when they can be reached these men may be more responsive than gay-identified men to risk reduction efforts. non-gay identified msm may have had less exposure to previous prevention messages so their initial exposure may have a greater impact. the greater effectiveness of interventions that include efforts to promote personal skills such as keeping condoms available and behavioral self-management indicates that such content merits strong consideration in development and delivery of new interventions for msm. and the finding that interventions were most effective for majority white populations underscores the critical need for effective interventions for msm of african and latino descent. further research measuring the incidence of hiv and other stds is needed. because most studies were conducted among mostly white men in the us and europe more evaluations of interventions are needed for african american and hispanic msm as well as msm in the developing world. more research is also needed to further clarify which behavioral strategies e.g. reducing unprotected anal sex having oral sex instead of anal sex reducing number of partners avoiding serodiscordant partners strategic positioning or reducing anal sex even with condom use are most effective in reducing transmission among msm the messages most effective in promoting these behaviors and the methods and settings in which these messages can be most effectively delivered.,there is insufficient evidence to support the use of psychological interventions to reduce hiv risk in hiv-infected men., there is insufficient evidence to support the use of safe sex for hiv-seropositive hiv prevention programmes in hiv treatment settings. these studies should focus on reducing the number of unprotected anal intercourse and reduce the rate of hiv transmission among hiv participants. the studies should be powered on the basis of the available evidence and should be interpreted with caution as they are likely to be of poor quality and to be effective in reducing hiv risk-related sexual behaviour.
432,the use of antiglucocorticoids in the treatment of mood disorders is at the proof-of-concept stage. considerable methodological differences exist between studies with respect to the compounds used and the patient cohorts studied. results in some diagnostic subtypes are promising and warrant further investigation to establish the clinical utility of these drugs in the treatment of mood disorders.,the is insufficient evidence to determine whether ketoconazole is associated with a significant reduction in depressive symptoms in patients with pmd., mifepristone may be effective in reducing depression scores in people with major depression but there is insufficient evidence to support its use as an adjunct to other antidepressants in patients with severe depression. there is no evidence to suggest that it is more effective than placebo in reducing depressive symptoms in people who are not treated with other antidepressants or that it may be associated with a reduction in mood scores in those who are treated with antidepressants.

437,no major advantages from any of the catheter-related interventions which have been purported to reduce the risk of pd peritonitis could be demonstrated in this review. the frequency and quality of available trials are suboptimal.,there is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of peritoneal catheters for the treatment of capd., peritoneal dialysis catheters are associated with a lower risk of peritonitis and exit-site infections than no-interventions. the catheter configuration is associated with higher rates of catheter-related complications and a decreased risk of infection. catheter survival was associated with lower rates of esi and catheter related complications. the risk of esis was higher with the catheter configuration than with the same configuration.
438,the optimum treatment for lgs remains uncertain and no study to date has shown any one drug to be highly efficacious rufinamide lamotrigine topiramate and felbamate may be helpful as add-on therapy clobazam may be helpful for drop seizures. until further research has been undertaken clinicians will need to continue to consider each patient individually taking into account the potential benefit of each therapy weighed against the risk of adverse effects.,there is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of lamotrigine for lennox-gastaut syndrome., antiepileptic drugs are effective in reducing seizure severity in lennox-gastaut syndrome. there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of these drugs as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of lennaox-Gastaut syndromes. however there is a need for further well-designed controlled trials to investigate the efficacy of these agents in reducing seizures in people with acute epilepsies.
439,there is not enough evidence to recommend any intervention for preventing excessive weight gain during pregnancy due to the significant methodological limitations of included studies and the small observed effect sizes. more high-quality randomised controlled trials with adequate sample sizes are required to evaluate the effectiveness of potential interventions.,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of dietary interventions to prevent weight gain in pregnant women., there is insufficient evidence to support the use of dietary and lifestyle interventions during pregnancy to prevent postpartum weight gain in pregnant women. there are insufficient data to support any recommendations for weight loss during pregnancy. there is a need for further trials to investigate the effects of dietary or lifestyle interventions on pregnancy outcomes. there was insufficient evidence for the use to support a reduction in pregnancy weight gain during the first trimester in women who are at high risk for gdm and there is no evidence for any other pregnancy outcome.

442,the potential benefit of antibiotics in the treatment of clinically diagnosed acute rhinosinusitis needs to be seen in the context of a high prevalence of adverse events. taking into account antibiotic resistance and the very low incidence of serious complications we conclude that there is no place for antibiotics for the patient with clinically diagnosed uncomplicated acute rhinosinusitis. this review cannot make recommendations for children patients with a suppressed immune system and patients with severe disease as these populations were not included in the available trials.,the is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of antibiotics in the treatment of acute sinusitis. further trials are needed., there is insufficient evidence to support the use of antibiotics for acute sinusitis in adults with acute rhinosinusitis. there is no evidence of benefit from antibiotics for the treatment of acute sininusitis in general practice. there are insufficient data to support antibiotic treatment in acute sinousitis in a general practice setting. we recommend that antibiotics should be used as first-line treatment in patients with severe symptoms. we also recommend that antibiotic treatment should be given as first line treatment in adults to reduce the risk of pneumonia and reduce the need for antibiotic treatment.
443,ino cannot be recommended for patients with ahrf. ino results in a transient improvement in oxygenation but does not reduce mortality and may be harmful.,there is insufficient evidence to support the use of inhaled nitric oxide as a treatment for acute respiratory distress syndrome., inhaled nitric oxide is effective in reducing respiratory failure in patients with ards but there is insufficient evidence to support its use as a treatment for people with severe hypoxia in ards. there are insufficient data to support the use of inhaled oxide as an effective treatment for patients with acute hypoxemia in adults. there is a need for further well-designed randomised controlled trials with adequate follow-up to determine the optimal dose-response and duration of treatment for these patients.
444,esa treatment in cancer patients increased on study mortality and worsened overall survival. for patients undergoing chemotherapy the increase was less pronounced but an adverse effect could not be excluded.,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of chemotherapy for patients with metastatic breast cancer., there is insufficient evidence to support the use of monosuppressive chemotherapy for cancer patients with haematopoietic response and/or severe anemia in patients with non-hodgkin's lymphoma<sep> patients with hemoglobin levels ≥sep<normal haemoglobin levels ≤sep>. haemotoxic chemotherapy is associated with a reduction in hemoglobin requirements and a decrease in the need for red blood cell transfusion.
445,there appears to be little basis for offering cse over epidurals in labour with no difference in overall maternal satisfaction despite a slightly faster onset with cse and conversely less pruritus with low-dose epidurals. there was no difference in ability to mobilise maternal hypotension rate of caesarean birth or neonatal outcome. however the significantly higher incidence of urinary retention rescue interventions and instrumental deliveries with traditional techniques would favour the use of low-dose epidurals. it is not possible to draw any meaningful conclusions regarding rare complications such as nerve injury and meningitis.,there is insufficient evidence to support the use of epidural analgesia in labour. there is a need for more well-designed trials., there is insufficient evidence to support the use of opioid analgesia during labour for analgesia in women with cephalic cervates. there is no evidence to suggest that opioids are more effective than epidural analgesia for pain relief during labour. there are insufficient data to support any of the other analgesia techniques for women with oxytocin use during labour and no studies are available to support this approach.
446,implications for practice oral borage oil and evening primrose oil lack effect on eczema improvement was similar to respective placebos used in trials. oral bo and epo are not effective treatments for eczema. in these studies along with the placebos epo and bo have the same fairly common mild transient adverse effects which are mainly gastrointestinal. the short-term studies included here do not examine possible adverse effects of long-term use of epo or bo. a case report warned that if epo is taken for a prolonged period of time more than one year there is a potential risk of inflammation thrombosis and immunosuppression another study found that epo may increase bleeding for people on coumadin® warfarin medication. implications for research noting that the confidence intervals between active and placebo treatment are narrow to exclude the possibility of any clinically useful difference we concluded that further studies on epo or bo for eczema would be hard to justify. this review does not provide information about long-term use of these products.,there is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of evening primrose oil for the treatment of atopic eczema., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of evening primrose oil for the treatment of eczema in people with atopic dermatitis. there is a need for further well-designed controlled trials to determine its efficacy and tolerability and to determine whether it is an effective treatment for atopic eczemitis in adults. the current available evidence is insufficient to support the routine use of this intervention in the management of this condition in people.
447,this review provides no clear evidence for the treatment of cirrhotic patients with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. in practice third generation cephalosporins have already been established as the standard treatment of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and it is clear that empirical antibiotic therapy should be provided in any case. however until large well-conducted trials provide more information practice will remain based on impression not evidence.,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of ciprofloxacin in cirrhotic patients with bacterial peritonitis., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of antimicrobials for bacterial peritonitis in cirrhotic patients. there is no evidence to suggest that antibiotics are effective in reducing infection rates in patients with bacterial perititis. however there is a need for further well-designed controlled trials to determine whether antibiotics are beneficial in patients who are not receiving antibiotics in order to reduce infection rates and reduce infection-related mortality in patients.
448,although the data suggest that prophylactic antibiotics help to prevent perineal wound complications following third or fourth-degree perineal tear loss to follow-up was very high. the results should be interpreted with caution as they are based on one small trial.,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of antibiotic prophylaxis in the treatment of perineal wound complications., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of antibiotic prophylactic antibiotics for preventing perineal complications after a vaginal delivery. there is a need for well-designed adequately powered randomised controlled trials with adequate follow-up to evaluate the effectiveness of antibiotic treatment for preventing premenstrual complications. such trials should be conducted in low-income countries where antibiotics are commonly used as first line agents.
449,the value of the various approaches to conservative management of postprostatectomy incontinence after radical prostatectomy remains uncertain. it seems unlikely that men benefit from one-to-one pelvic floor muscle training therapy after transurethral resection of the prostate turp). long-term incontinence may be managed by external penile clamp but there are safety problems.,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of pelvic floor exercises in the treatment of radical prostatectomy. there is a need for more rigorous well-designed and well-conducted trials., pfe is effective in reducing urinary incontinence after pfmt after radical prostatectomy for men who are incontinent after bladder diaries. pfs is effective for improving urinary continence after pfs. the use of biofeedback may be associated with a reduction in the risk of severe urinary obstruction and a decrease in the need for more intensive urinary exercises. the treatment of patients with severe urinary obstructions following pfs does not appear to be effective for men with normal urinary control after bladder-specific resection of the prostate but is associated with increased urinary volume and a decreased risk of urinary obstruction.
450,bupropion increases smoking abstinence rates in smokers with schizophrenia without jeopardizing their mental state. varenicline may also improve smoking cessation rates in schizophrenia but its possible psychiatric adverse effects cannot be ruled out. cr may help this group of patients to quit and reduce smoking in the short term. we failed to find convincing evidence that other interventions have a beneficial effect on smoking in schizophrenia.,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of nicotine replacement therapy for schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. further randomised controlled trials are needed to assess the effect of nicotine therapy on smoking cessation., there is insufficient evidence to support the use of smoking cessation strategies for people with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorders. there is a need for more studies to investigate the effectiveness of smoking reduction strategies for patients with schizophrenia and schizoective disorders and to compare the effects of different types of smoking strategies for those with schizophrenia with other types of schizophrenia and to evaluate the effect of other forms of smoking treatment for people who are atypical schizophrenia and who are willing to quit.
451,this review shows a trend towards greater effectiveness with dual chamber pacing compared to single chamber ventricular pacing which supports the current british pacing and electrophysiology group's guidelines regarding atrioventricular block. additional randomised controlled trial evidence from ongoing trials in this area will further inform the debate.,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of vvir or vvi pacing for the prevention of atrial fibrillation., there is insufficient evidence to support the use of vvi pacing for the prevention of stroke and cardiovascular events in people with sinus-node dysfunction. there is a need for further trials to determine the optimal pacing mode for patients with sss and to compare vvi and ddd pacing with vvi paces for prevention of atrial ischemia and cardiovascular complications in patients with a history of atrioventricular conduction.
452,there is limited evidence that contracts can potentially contribute to improving adherence but there is insufficient evidence from large good quality studies to routinely recommend contracts for improving adherence to treatment or preventive health regimens.,there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of contingency contracting in the treatment of alcohol dependence. further research is needed., there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the effectiveness of interventions to reduce the prevalence of alcohol misuse in people with non-insulin-dependent diabetes. there is a need for more high quality trials to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of interventions for alcohol misuse and other types of alcohol use disorders in patients with diabetes. future research should focus on improving the quality of life of people with alcohol misuse. future trials should include adequately powered randomised controlled trials.
