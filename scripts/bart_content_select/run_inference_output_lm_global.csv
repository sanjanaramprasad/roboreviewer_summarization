0," There is inadequate evidence to draw strong conclusions on the efficacy or safety of the drug interventions included in this review. There is some low quality evidence from a meta-analysis of two studies investigating urokinase (various strengths) and some very low evidence from two single studies investigating alteplase 2 mg/2 mL that suggest that these two drug interventions may be effective in treating withdrawal or total occlusion of CVC lumens caused by thrombosis. Further high quality, sufficiently powered research is still required to look at the efficacy and safety of urokinase, alteplase and other chemical, surgical and drug interventions for treating CVC lumen occlusion. Research studies which exclusively include child participants are especially warranted."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of antifibrinolytic agents in the treatment of CVAD.

3," The limited available evidence suggests folate may have a potential role as a supplement to other treatment for depression.

4," Intensive interventions, unsuited to primary care or population prevention programmes, provide only minimal reductions in blood pressure during long-term trials. Further evaluations to assess effects on morbidity and mortality outcomes are needed for populations as a whole and for patients with elevated blood pressure. A low sodium diet may help in maintenance of lower blood pressure following withdrawal of antihypertensives. If this is confirmed, with no increase in cardiovascular events, then targeting of comprehensive dietary and behavioural programmes in patients with elevated blood pressure requiring drug treatment would be justified."," Sodium restriction is associated with a reduction in blood pressure and blood pressure in patients with hypertension. However, there is no evidence of a significant difference in mortality, cardiovascular morbidity or morbidity between sodium restriction and sodium restriction, or between sodium and potassium restriction. Sodium restriction does not appear to have a significant impact on blood pressure or blood pressure, but may have a beneficial effect on cardiovascular risk factors, such as hypertension and diabetes

7," The available evidence indicates some beneficial effects with second-generation antipsychotics, mood stabilisers, and dietary supplementation by omega-3 fatty acids. However, these are mostly based on single study effect estimates. Antidepressants are not widely supported for BPD treatment, but may be helpful in the presence of comorbid conditions. Total BPD severity was not significantly influenced by any drug. No promising results are available for the core BPD symptoms of chronic feelings of emptiness, identity disturbance and abandonment. Conclusions have to be drawn carefully in the light of several limitations of the RCT evidence that constrain applicability to everyday clinical settings (among others, patients' characteristics and duration of interventions and observation periods)."," Weight loss is associated with a significant increase in weight gain. Weight loss appears to be associated with an increase in depressive symptoms, but there is no clear evidence of an effect on weight loss in the short-term or longer term. Weight gain appears to have a beneficial effect on depressive symptoms and on self-reported depressive symptoms. However, weight loss is not a significant issue for people with borderline personality disorder, and there is a need for further well-designed studies.","<study> <population> patients with recurrent

17," This update has provided additional confirmation on the effectiveness of antidepressants for neuropathic pain and has provided new information on another antidepressant - venlafaxine. There is still limited evidence for the role of SSRIs. Whether antidepressants prevent the development of neuropathic pain (pre-emptive use) is still unclear. Both TCAs and venlafaxine have NNTs of approximately three. This means that for approximately every three patients with neuropathic pain who are treated with either of these antidepressants, one will get at least moderate pain relief. There is evidence to suggest that other antidepressants may be effective but numbers of participants are insufficient to calculate robust NNTs.

19," Oseltamivir and zanamivir appear to have modest benefit in reducing duration of illness in children with influenza. However, our analysis was limited by small sample sizes and an inability to pool data from different studies. In addition, the inclusion of data from published trials only may have resulted in significant publication bias. Based on published trial data, oseltamivir reduces the incidence of acute otitis media in children aged one to five years but is associated with a significantly increased risk of vomiting. One study demonstrated that laninamivir octanoate was more effective than oseltamivir in shortening duration of illness in children with oseltamivir-resistant influenza A/H1N1. The benefit of oseltamivir and zanamivir in preventing the transmission of influenza in households is modest and based on weak evidence.

24," T-tube drainage appeared to result in significantly longer operating time and hospital stay compared with primary closure without any apparent evidence of benefit on clinically important outcomes after open common bile duct exploration. Based on the currently available evidence, there is no justification for the routine use of T-tube drainage after open common bile duct exploration in patients with common bile duct stones. T-tube drainage should not be used outside well designed randomised clinical trials. More randomised trials comparing the effects of T-tube drainage versus primary closure after open common bile duct exploration may be needed. Such trials should be conducted with low risk of bias and assessing the long-term beneficial and harmful effects of T-tube drainage, including long-term complications such as bile stricture and recurrence of common bile duct stones."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of bile acids for the treatment of postoperative bacteremia.

30," Medication treatments can be effective in paediatric anxiety disorders, acting to reduce core symptoms, and should be considered as part of the treatment of these disorders. The greatest number of trials showing efficacy to date have assessed the SSRIs in treating paediatric OCD. There is no clear evidence to show that any particular class of medication is more effective or better tolerated than any other. As quantitative data was only available for the SSRIs and venlafaxine the routine use of benzodiazepines cannot be recommended, especially given concerns of dependency and treatment -related emergent adverse events associated with this class of drugs. Future RCTs could help identify potential clinical moderators of treatment efficacy. Studies of the long-term efficacy of medication treatment, optimal dosage, as well as direct comparisons of pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy are also warranted."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the effectiveness of psychotherapy for anxiety disorders in children and adolescents with anxiety disorders. Further research is needed to determine the effectiveness, safety and efficacy, and to compare psychotherapy with other psychotherapy options, including antidepressants, antidepressants, and antidepressants, as well as to determine whether psychotherapy is more effective or less effective than placebo.

33," PGS as currently performed significantly decreases live birth rates in women of advanced maternal age and those with repeated IVF failure. Trials in which PGS was offered to women with a good prognosis suggested similar outcomes. PGS technique development is still ongoing in an effort to increase its efficacy. This involves biopsy at other stages of development (polar body or trophectoderm biopsy) and other methods of analysis (comparative genome hybridisation (CGH) or array-based technologies) than used by the trials included in this review. These new developments should be properly evaluated before their routine clinical application. Until such trials have been performed, PGS should not be offered as routine patient care in any form."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the existence of a correlation between embryo transfer rates and live birth rate. Further research is needed to identify the best way to integrate embryo transfer into the management of live birth rates and to compare embryo transfer with other methods of embryo retrieval.

42," We found no evidence to support antioxidant supplements for primary or secondary prevention. Beta-carotene and vitamin E seem to increase mortality, and so may higher doses of vitamin A. Antioxidant supplements need to be considered as medicinal products and should undergo sufficient evaluation before marketing."," Vitamin E supplementation is associated with a reduction in the incidence of all-cause mortality and cardiovascular disease. Vitamin E supplements are associated with an increase in the number of cases of adverse events, including cardiac arrest, and a decrease in the risk of stroke, but no significant difference in total deaths or hospitalizations. Vitamin A supplements do not appear to have a significant impact on mortality or cardiovascular disease, but may have a beneficial effect on the incidence and severity of these adverse events. Vitamins E and zinc supplementing supplements may reduce mortality and morbidity, but further research is needed to confirm this.","<study> <population> Two hundred and eighty-nine patients with ALS

48," For the considered outcomes, it seems that adding any psychosocial support to standard maintenance treatments do not add additional benefits. Data do not show differences also for contingency approaches, contrary to all expectations. Duration of the studies was too short to analyse relevant outcomes such as mortality. It should be noted that the control intervention used in the studies included in the review on maintenance treatments, is a program that routinely offers counselling sessions in addition to methadone; thus the review, actually, did not evaluate the question of whether any ancillary psychosocial intervention is needed when methadone maintenance is provided, but the narrower question of whether a specific more structured intervention provides any additional benefit to a standard psychosocial support. These interventions probably can be measured and evaluated by employing diverse criteria for evaluating treatment outcomes, aimed to rigorously assess changes in emotional, interpersonal, vocational and physical health areas of life functioning."," Counselling attendance appears to have a positive effect on retention of abstinence. However, it is not clear whether it has an effect on relapse or relapse rates, or on relapse rates or relapse rate, or whether counselling attendance has a negative impact on relapse rate and relapse rates. The results of this review suggest that counselling attendance may have an important impact on retention in abstinence, but that it is unlikely that it will have a significant impact on quality of life.","<study> <population> opioid-addicted persons <sep> Fourteen methadone maintenance individuals </population> </study> <study> <population> Opiate addicts beginning a new treatment episode on a

51," Family intervention may reduce the number of relapse events and hospitalisations and would therefore be of interest to people with schizophrenia, clinicians and policy makers. However, the treatment effects of these trials may be overestimated due to the poor methodological quality. Further data from trials that describe the methods of randomisation, test the blindness of the study evaluators, and implement the CONSORT guidelines would enable greater confidence in these findings."," Family counselling is effective in reducing relapse rates in people with schizophrenia and family distress. Family counselling may reduce relapse rates, but it is not clear whether it has an impact on quality of life. Family counseling is effective as an adjunct to other psychotherapeutic approaches, but is associated with a higher rate of psychological distress and a decreased rate of depression. Family therapy may be effective as a component of a broader range of psychotherapies, but its effectiveness is unclear. Family counsellors may have a role to play in the management of relapse, but the quality of the evidence is low and the number of studies is low. Further research is needed to assess the effectiveness of family counselling as a part of a multifaceted approach.","<study> <population> patients with comorbid schizophrenia and alcohol or drug abuse

56, This review of randomised controlled trials showed that vigabatrin can reduce seizure frequency in people with drug-resistant partial epilepsy. Short-term follow-up of patients showed that some side effects were associated with its use. Further analysis of longer-term observational studies is required to evaluate how likely patients are to develop visual field defects and whether such side effects are associated with dose and duration of drug use.," Vigilant vigabatrin is effective in reducing the number of seizures and the frequency of adverse events. Its efficacy appears to be similar to that of gabapentin, but with a higher incidence of adverse effects. Its effectiveness is similar to its effectiveness in the control of seizures with GVG, but it is not clear whether it is more effective than GVG in reducing seizures with or without GVG. It is unclear whether it has an effect on other adverse events, such as nausea or vomiting, or on quality of life, but its efficacy appears similar to GVG with respect to frequency and severity of adverse event profiles. Vigilant gabavatrin appears to have a similar efficacy to GGV, but has a higher risk of having an adverse event profile. Its use is associated with an increased risk of narcolepsy, and a decreased risk of seizures in the long term. Its adverse effects are similar to those of GVG but its use is not associated with a reduction in seizures in GVG or GVG alone. Its duration is longer than that of other GVG agonist drugs. It appears that Vigilant GGB is more likely to have an adverse effect on GVG and GVG compared to GGB, but the exact duration of the treatment is unclear. Vigilante GGB has a longer duration and is less likely to cause adverse events in the short term. It has a shorter duration and has a lower risk of relapse, but is less clear in the longer term.","<study> <population> 24 patients with refractory epilepsy <sep> refractory epilepsy </population> </study> <study> <population> Ninety-seven patients entered this seven-centre <sep> patients with uncontrolled partial seizures <sep> uncontrolled partial seizures <sep> patients with partial seizures </population> </study> <study> <population> epilepsy <sep> patients with focal epilepsy whose complex partial seizures </population> </study> <study> <population> epilepsy <sep> 23 adult outpatients with severe drug-resistant epilepsy (17 with partial seizures </population> </study> <study> <population> 19 patients who completed the study, 17 had partial seizures, eight of whom had secondary generalization and two who had primary generalized seizures <sep> n = 1), intolerance to GVG therapy (n = 2), or poor seizure record (n = 1 <sep> therapy-resistant epileptic patients </population> </study> <study> <population> Thirty-one patients with severe drug-resistant epilepsy entered the study <sep> patients with severe complex partial epilepsy <sep> Thirty patients completed both periods <sep> drug-resistant epilepsy <sep> 15 patients presenting with </population> </study> <study> <population> Forty five patients with refractory partial seizures <sep> Ten of 20 patients on </population> </study> <study> <population> 174 patients with previously uncontrolled complex partial seizures with or without secondary generalization <sep> patients with uncontrolled complex partial seizures </population> </study> <study> <population> partial epilepsy <sep> Twenty-one patients suffering from difficult to control complex partial seizures participated;

57," In adolescents and adults with sub-optimal control on low dose ICS monotherapy, the combination of LABA and ICS is modestly more effective in reducing the risk of exacerbations requiring oral corticosteroids than a higher dose of ICS. Combination therapy also led to modestly greater improvement in lung function, symptoms and use of rescue ß2 agonists and to fewer withdrawals due to poor asthma control than with a higher dose of inhaled corticosteroids. Apart from an increased rate of tremor and less oral candidiasis with combination therapy, the two options appear relatively safe in adults although adverse effects associated with long-term ICS treatment were seldom monitored. In children, combination therapy did not lead to a significant reduction, but rather a trend towards an increased risk, of oral steroid-treated exacerbations and hospital admissions. These trends raised concern about the safety of combination therapy in view of modest improvement in children under the age of 12 years.", There is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of salbutamol as a substitute for salbutafil in the treatment of patients with asthma who are unable to tolerate or tolerate salbutaminophen.

60," A significant health disparity exists, whereby Indigenous populations, a minority, are over-represented in the burden of smoking-related morbidity and mortality. This review highlights the paucity of evidence available to evaluate the effectiveness of smoking cessation interventions, despite the known success of these interventions in non-Indigenous populations. Due to this lack of published investigations, the external validity of this review is limited, as is the ability to draw reliable conclusions from the results. The limited but available evidence reported does indicate that smoking cessation interventions specifically targeted at Indigenous populations can produce smoking abstinence. However this evidence base is not strong with a small number of methodologically sound trials investigating these interventions. More rigorous trials are now required to assist in bridging the gap between tobacco related health disparities in Indigenous and non-Indigenous populations."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the effectiveness of nicotine replacement therapy for quitting tobacco use.

62, Internal fixation is associated with less initial operative trauma but has an increased risk of re-operation on the hip. Definite conclusions cannot be made for differences in pain and residual disability between the two groups. Future studies should concentrate on better reporting of final outcome measures and function. There is still a need for studies to define which patient groups are better served by the different treatment methods.," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the existence of any difference in mortality rates between orthopaedic and robotic hip replacements. Further research is needed to determine the best way to minimise the risk of bias in this review and to assess the effectiveness of robotic hip replacement as a replacement for traditional hip replacement. Finally, there is a need for a well-designed, well-conducted and executed randomised controlled trial to evaluate the effects of robotic replacement on mortality rates and to compare robotic

63," The evidence from this review suggests that there are no clinically meaningful BP lowering differences between available ARBs. The BP lowering effect of ARBs is modest and similar to ACE inhibitors as a class; the magnitude of average trough BP lowering for ARBs at maximum recommended doses and above is -8/-5 mmHg. Furthermore, 60 to 70% of this trough BP lowering effect occurs with recommended starting doses. The review did not provide a good estimate of the incidence of harms associated with ARBs because of the short duration of the trials and the lack of reporting of adverse effects in many of the trials."," There is no evidence to support or refute the use of hydrocortisone in reducing blood pressure in patients with hypertension. However, the amount of blood pressure reduction achieved was not significantly different from that achieved in the control group. There is a need for further well-designed, well-conducted and reported randomised controlled trials to determine the optimal dose and duration of hydocortisones in hypertension.","<study> <population>

64," There was evidence individual TFCBT, EMDR, stress management and group TFCBT are effective in the treatment of PTSD. Other non-trauma focused psychological treatments did not reduce PTSD symptoms as significantly. There was some evidence that individual TFCBT and EMDR are superior to stress management in the treatment of PTSD at between 2 and 5 months following treatment, and also that TFCBT, EMDR and stress management were more effective than other therapies. There was insufficient evidence to determine whether psychological treatment is harmful. There was some evidence of greater drop-out in active treatment groups. The considerable unexplained heterogeneity observed in these comparisons, and the potential impact of publication bias on these data, suggest the need for caution in interpreting the results of this review."," Psychotherapy appears to be a useful tool in the treatment of PTSD and its aftermath. However, there is insufficient evidence to recommend its use as an adjunct to other psychotherapy. Further research is needed to assess the effectiveness of psychotherapy for PTSD, and to compare psychotherapy with other psychological therapies, as well as to assess its effectiveness in other conditions, such as sleep deprivation, depression, insomnia, fatigue, sleep deprivation and fatigue.","<study> <population> Twenty-one subjects were entered, and 18 completed <sep> posttraumatic

73," No male hormonal contraceptive is ready for clinical use. Most trials were small exploratory studies. Their power to detect important differences was limited and their results imprecise. In addition, assessment of azoospermia can vary by sensitivity of the method used. Future trials need more attention to the methodological requirements for RCTs. More trials with adequate power would also be helpful."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of male hormones in the management of spermatogenesis. Men using male hormones should be encouraged to take part in this review. Men should be advised that male hormones do not appear to have a significant impact on sperm production. Men taking male hormones are unlikely to have an adverse effect on their sperm production, but men taking female hormones may have an increased risk of developing prostate cancer. Men who take male hormones will have a decreased risk of prostate cancer, but the number of men who develop prostate cancer will be reduced by male hormones. Women should be informed of the risks and benefits of male hormonal supplements and the possibility that male hormone supplements may have a negative effect on the sperm production of sperm producing

When closure of pilonidal sinuses is the desired surgical option, off-midline closure should be the standard management."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of any particular surgical technique for removing surgical sutures in patients with sinus infections.

87, There was no clear evidence of any effect of corticosteroids on substantive clinical outcomes. Those receiving steroids showed significantly greater improvement in platelet counts which was greater for those receiving dexamethasone than those receiving betamethasone.

The use of corticosteroids may be justified in clinical situations in which increased rate of recovery in platelet count is considered clinically worthwhile.," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of beta-blockers in the treatment of HELLP syndrome. There is a need for further research in this area, particularly in the context of the introduction of antiplatelet agents, as well as in the development of a more efficient treatment strategy.

90," Two intervention types, the specialist epilepsy nurse and self-management education, have some evidence of benefit. However, we did not find clear evidence that other service models substantially improve outcomes for adults with epilepsy. It is also possible that benefits are situation specific and may not generalise to other settings. These studies included only a small number of service providers whose individual competence or expertise may have had a significant impact on outcomes. At present it is not possible to advocate any single model of service provision."," Cognitive behavioural therapy is effective in reducing the severity of depression and reducing the frequency of depressive symptoms. Positive effects of cognitive behavioural therapy are similar to those seen in other types of psychiatric therapy, but are associated with a higher incidence of depression. Cognitive behavioral therapy is less effective than behavioural therapy. Cognitive behavioural counselling is more effective than no treatment, but is associated with an increased risk of relapse. Cognitive behaviour therapy is more likely to result in an improvement in quality of life, but its effectiveness is not clear. Cognitive behavior therapy may be more effective in the treatment of depression or anxiety symptoms than behavioural counselling, but there is no clear evidence of an effect on severity or duration of depression in people with epilepsy.

91," Most active recruitment strategies for breast cancer screening programs examined in this review were more effective than no intervention. Combinations of effective interventions can have an important effect. Some costly strategies, as a home visit and a letter of invitation to multiple screening examinations plus educational material, were not effective. Further reviews comparing the effective interventions and studies that include cost-effectiveness, women's satisfaction and equity issues are needed."," Screening mammography results in a significant reduction in the incidence of pap smears, but a significant increase in the risk of breast cancer. Screening results in an increase in breast cancer screening rates, but no significant difference in overall survival. Screenings are also associated with a significant decrease in the number of smear-related deaths, but this is based on a small number of studies with short-term follow-up and a very low risk of bias.

96," We found conflicting evidence for erythropoiesis-stimulating agents to increase quality of life and hemoglobin level by treating anemia in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. However, this conclusion is based on randomized controlled trials with a high risk of bias, and relies on trials assessing human recombinant erythropoietin (EPO).

97," The use of ergometrine-oxytocin as part of the routine active management of the third stage of labour appears to be associated with a small but statistically significant reduction in the risk of PPH when compared to oxytocin for blood loss of 500 ml or more. No statistically significant difference was observed between the groups for blood loss of 1000 ml or more. A statistically significant difference was observed in the presence of maternal side-effects, including elevation of diastolic blood pressure, vomiting and nausea, associated with ergometrine-oxytocin use compared to oxytocin use. Thus, the advantage of a reduction in the risk of PPH, between 500 and 1000 ml blood loss, needs to be weighed against the adverse side-effects associated with the use of ergometrine-oxytocin."," Manual removal of the placenta reduces the risk of postpartum haemorrhage and the need for blood transfusion, but there is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of this procedure as a substitute for manual removal.

101," There is a lack of evidence of effectiveness of the included interventions. Motivational interviewing and some family interventions may have some benefit. Cost-effectiveness has not yet been addressed in any studies, and further research is needed to determine whether any of these interventions can be recommended."," Parenting skills are effective in reducing sexual risk behaviours, reducing sexual initiation rates, reducing violence, and reducing violence. They are also effective in preventing sexual initiation and sexual initiation, reducing violent initiation rates and decreasing violence rates. Parenting Skills are effective as a tool to reduce sexual initiation rate, but they are also associated with a reduction in violence rates and violence rates, and a decreased risk of sexual initiation. Parents and their children are more likely to report positive results, but the quality of the evidence is low. Parents should be encouraged to take part in the evaluation of parent-child relationship skills as a core component of their parenting skills. Parents need to be aware of the risks and benefits of parenting skills as an integral part of the parenting skills programme, and of the role of parent training in reducing violence and violence. Parents also need to take into account the fact that parents and children are likely to respond negatively to parenting skills, and that they may have a role to play in helping parents to improve their own parenting skills and behaviours. Parents, children and parents need to weigh the potential benefits and drawbacks of parenting Skills as a standalone component of the programme, as well as the potential drawbacks and drawbacks. Parents can expect to be disappointed with the results of this review. Parents deserve to be informed of the potential pitfalls and pitfalls of coaching skills as part of their role in parenting skills programmes. Parents may also expect to find satisfaction with coaching skills, but this is unlikely to be sustained. Parents are also likely to have an easier time with parenting skills than their children, and will have a better understanding of the mechanisms by which parenting skills work. Parents have a greater chance of being disappointed with their child's behaviour, and may have more opportunities to seek support from parents and their carers. Parent training may also have an impact on behaviour change, but it is unclear whether this will translate into a greater proportion of successful parenting skills being employed as a part of a parenting programme.

107," Breathing exercises over four to 15 weeks improve functional exercise capacity in people with COPD compared to no intervention; however, there are no consistent effects on dyspnoea or health-related quality of life. Outcomes were similar across all the breathing exercises examined. Treatment effects for patient-reported outcomes may have been overestimated owing to lack of blinding. Breathing exercises may be useful to improve exercise tolerance in selected individuals with COPD who are unable to undertake exercise training; however, these data do not suggest a widespread role for breathing exercises in the comprehensive management of people with COPD."," Exercise training may improve lung function in people with dyspnea, but there is insufficient evidence to recommend exercise training as an exercise training exercise programme. Exercise training appears to have a beneficial effect on lung function and fitness capacity, but its effects on health-related quality of life are unclear. Exercise programs appear to be beneficial in improving lung function, but their effect on fitness capacity is not clear. Further research is needed to assess the effects of exercise training on fitness performance and fitness, and to compare exercise training with other forms of exercise.","<study> <population> chronic

108," Stepwise and partial excavation reduced the incidence of pulp exposure in symptomless, vital, carious primary as well as permanent teeth. Therefore these techniques show clinical advantage over complete caries removal in the management of dentinal caries. There was no evidence of a difference in signs or symptoms of pulpal disease between stepwise excavation, and complete caries removal, and insufficient evidence to determine whether or not there was a difference in signs and symptoms of pulp disease between partial caries removal and complete caries removal. When partial caries removal was carried out there was also insufficient evidence to determine whether or not there is a difference in risk of restoration failure. The no dentinal caries removal studies investigating permanent teeth had a similar result with no difference in restoration failure. The other no dentinal caries removal study, which investigated primary teeth, showed a statistically significant difference in restoration failure favouring the intervention. Due to the short term follow-up in most of the included studies and the high risk of bias, further high quality, long term clinical trials are still required to assess the most effective intervention. However, it should be noted that in studies of this nature, complete elimination of risk of bias may not necessarily be possible. Future research should also investigate patient centred outcomes."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of any particular type of toothpaste in the treatment of tooth decay.

125," Improvement in control of maternal blood pressure with use of beta-blockers would be worthwhile only if it were reflected in substantive benefits for mother and/or baby, and none have been clearly demonstrated. The effect of beta-blockers on perinatal outcome is uncertain; the worrying trend to an increase in SGA infants is partly dependent on one small outlying trial. Large randomised trials are needed to determine whether antihypertensive therapy in general (rather than beta-blocker therapy specifically) results in greater benefit than risk, for treatment of mild-moderate pregnancy hypertension. If so, then it would be appropriate to consider which antihypertensive is best, and beta-blockers should be evaluated. [Note: the seventeen reports in the awaiting classification section of the review may alter the conclusions of the review once assessed.]"," Propranolol is effective in reducing blood pressure in preterm or newborn patients with hypertension, but its use is associated with a reduction in the number of deaths and the rate of hypoglycaemia. Its use is also associated with an increased risk of maternal death, a decreased risk of neonatal death, and a decrease in the incidence of maternal hyperglycaemia, an increase in neonatal mortality and a decreased rate of maternal mortality. Its effect on maternal mortality is not clear from this review, but is likely to be underestimated.","<study> <population> 176 pregnant women with mild to moderate hypertension <sep> hypertension in

128," Antibiotic prophylaxis in afebrile neutropenic patients significantly reduced all-cause mortality. In our review, the most significant reduction in mortality was observed in trials assessing prophylaxis with quinolones.

129," Results of this review do not provide sufficient evidence in favour of anticonvulsants for the treatment of AWS. There are some suggestions that carbamazepine may actually be more effective in treating some aspects of alcohol withdrawal when compared to benzodiazepines, the current first-line regimen for alcohol withdrawal syndrome. Anticonvulsants seem to have limited side effects, although adverse effects are not rigorously reported in the analysed trials."," Oxcarbazepam appears to have a beneficial effect on sleepiness and tolerability in the treatment of alcohol withdrawal syndrome. However, its use is associated with a significant increase in adverse events, such as sleepiness, fatigue, insomnia and sleepiness. Its use is not associated with an increase in sleepiness or fatigue, but its use may be associated with increased risk of sleepiness in some patients. Its efficacy is not clear from this review, as the majority of the articles in this review were published in the United Kingdom.","<study> <population> Thirty-six hospitalized patients experiencing

132," This review suggests that the use of fluoride supplements is associated with a reduction in caries increment when compared with no fluoride supplement in permanent teeth. The effect of fluoride supplements was unclear on deciduous teeth. When compared with the administration of topical fluorides, no differential effect was observed. We rated 10 trials as being at unclear risk of bias and one at high risk of bias, and therefore the trials provide weak evidence about the efficacy of fluoride supplements."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of any particular type of antiplatelet agent in the treatment of caries.

133," There is evidence for significant beneficial effects of regular exercise on physical fitness, walking capacity, cardiovascular dimensions (e.g. blood pressure and heart rate), health-related quality of life and some nutritional parameters in adults with CKD. Other outcomes had insufficient evidence due to the lack of data from RCTs. The design of the exercise intervention causes difference in effect size and should be considered when prescribing exercise with the aim of affecting a certain outcome. Future RCTs should focus more on the effects of resistance training interventions or mixed cardiovascular- and resistance training as these exercise types have not been studied as much as cardiovascular exercise."," The results of this review support the use of exercise as a measure of exercise performance and fitness capacity. Exercise as a standalone measure of fitness capacity is associated with a reduction in blood pressure and a decreased risk of cardiovascular disease. Exercise is also associated with an increase in cardiovascular disease, a decrease in stroke, and a reduced risk of cardiac arrhythmias. Exercise programmes are associated with improved fitness capacity and reduced risk factors for cardiovascular disease and cardiovascular disease in the short term. Exercise programs are associated by a reduction of blood pressure, but the exact magnitude of this reduction is unclear. Exercise program programs are not associated with increased risk of heart attack or stroke, but they are likely to have a negative impact on fitness capacity, cardiovascular health, physical functioning and quality of life. Exercise may be considered as an option for exercising, but further research is needed.","<study> <population> Self-care hemodialysis patients (EX, n = 6) performed <sep> end-stage renal disease

134," The review suggests a substantial caries-inhibiting effect of fluoride varnish in both the permanent and the deciduous dentitions based largely on trials with no treatment controls. There is little information concerning acceptability of treatment or possible side effects in the included trials. Given the relatively poor quality of most of the included studies and the wide confidence intervals around the estimates of effect, there remains a need for further trials. It is important that these trials should be of high quality and include assessment of potential adverse effects."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of sugar as a substitute for toothpastes in the treatment of caries progression.

136," Overall, there is preliminary evidence that a variety of cognitive-behavioral interventions can be used with children and adolescents to successfully manage or reduce pain and distress associated with needle-related procedures. However, many of the included studies received lower quality scores because they failed to describe the randomization procedure and participant withdrawals or drop-outs from the study. Further RCTs need to be conducted, particularly for the many interventions for which we could not locate any trials."," Psychotherapy is effective in reducing pain severity in children and adolescents. Psychotherapy may also reduce pain intensity in adults, but there is no clear evidence of a difference in pain severity between psychotherapy and psychological therapy alone. Practical psychotherapy may be more effective than psychological therapy, but more research is needed to assess the effects of psychotherapy on pain severity and psychological wellbeing in

140," In those clinical settings where surgical expertise and equipment are available and affordable, diagnostic laparoscopy and LA (either in combination or separately) seem to have various advantages over OA. Some of the clinical effects of LA, however, are small and of limited clinical relevance. In spite of the mediocre quality of the available research data, we would generally recommend to use laparoscopy and LA in patients with suspected appendicitis unless laparoscopy itself is contraindicated or not feasible. Especially young female, obese, and employed patients seem to benefit from LA."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of antibiotics in the recovery of appendic appendicectomy. Further research is needed to determine the effectiveness of antibiotics for appendicotomy, and to compare the effectiveness and safety of antibiotics with other types of antibiotics. Finally, there is a need for a meta-analysis of the effects of antibiotic prophylaxis on appendic rupture and recovery time, as well as to compare antibiotics with each other.","<study> <population>

142," There was a small reduction in the length of the third stage of labour and also in the amount of blood loss when cord drainage was applied compared with no cord drainage. The clinical importance of such observed statistically significant reductions, is open to debate. There is no clear difference in the need for manual removal of placenta, blood transfusion or the risk of postpartum haemorrhage. Due to small trials with medium risk of bias, the results should be interpreted with caution."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of oxytocin for the treatment of third stage of labour. Further randomized controlled trials are needed to determine the effectiveness of oxycodone for this purpose. Such trials should be conducted in the United States, Europe and Asia, and should include measures of maternal satisfaction with childbirth.

143," The studies included in this meta-analysis were generally small and methodologically prone to bias, which makes it impossible to arrive at a definitive conclusion about the effectiveness of manipulative therapies for infantile colic. The majority of the included trials appeared to indicate that the parents of infants receiving manipulative therapies reported fewer hours crying per day than parents whose infants did not, based on contemporaneous crying diaries, and this difference was statistically significant. The trials also indicate that a greater proportion of those parents reported improvements that were clinically significant. However, most studies had a high risk of performance bias due to the fact that the assessors (parents) were not blind to who had received the intervention. When combining only those trials with a low risk of such performance bias, the results did not reach statistical significance. Further research is required where those assessing the treatment outcomes do not know whether or not the infant has received a manipulative therapy. There are inadequate data to reach any definitive conclusions about the safety of these interventions."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the effectiveness of CPAP in reducing the amount of crying or waking up in wake-up infants. Further research is needed to determine the effectiveness and safety of this intervention in waking up infants with CPAP, as well as to assess its effectiveness in waking-up children. Finally, there is a need for a well-designed, well-conducted and reported systematic review of the efficacy and safety aspects of CPAC for waking up children with crying and waking up babies.","<study> <population> infantile colic <sep> 28 infants with colic </population> </study> <study> <population> A private chiropractic practice and the National Health Service's health visitor nurses in the suburb Ballerup (Copenhagen, Denmark <sep> infantile colic </population> </study> <study> <population> Nine infants were excluded because inclusion criteria were not met, and five dropped out, leaving 86 who completed the study <sep> infantile colic <sep> One hundred infants with typical colicky pain </population> </study>",<study> <interventions> cranial osteopathic treatment <sep> cranial osteopathic manipulation or no treatment </interventions> </study> <study> <interventions> spinal manipulation <sep> Spinal manipulation <sep> dimethicone </interventions> </study> <study> <interventions> chiropractic spinal manipulation <sep> placebo <sep> Chiropractic spinal manipulation </interventions> </study>,"<study> <outcomes> time spent crying, sleeping and being held/rocked on a 24-hour diary <sep> Overall decline in crying <sep> time spent sleeping <sep> sleeping <sep> parental attention </outcomes> </study> <study> <outcomes> crying <sep> hours of crying </outcomes> </study> <study> <outcomes> chiropractic spinal manipulation </outcomes> </study>","<study> <punchline_text> Overall decline in crying was 63% and 23%, respectively, for treated and controls; improvement in sleeping was 11% and 2%. </punchline_text> <punchline_effect> ↑ sig increase </punchline_effect> </study> <study> <punchline_text> By trial days 4 to 7, hours of crying were reduced by 1 hour in the dimethicone group compared with 2.4 hours in the manipulation group (P =.04). </punchline_text> <punchline_effect> ↓ sig decrease </punchline_effect> </study> <study> <punchline_text> Thirty two of 46 infants in the treatment group (69.9%), and 24 of 40 in the control group (60.0%), showed some degree of improvement. </punchline_text> <punchline_effect> ― no diff </punchline_effect> </study>"

145," Our review update included data from four new randomised studies of the ketogenic diet. Although none were blinded, some were of good quality. These studies suggest that in children, the ketogenic diet results in short to medium term benefits in seizure control, the effects of which are comparable to modern antiepileptic drugs. However, one study of long term outcome reports a high attrition rate for the diet. This would suggest that many children find the diet difficult to tolerate. The main reasons for drop-outs in the included studies included gastrointestinal side effects and dislike for the diet. We found just three studies on the use of the diet in adults and none of these were randomised. There has been less research involving other diets. We found one randomised study of reasonable quality of the Atkins diet. This study showed similar benefits in seizure control with a less restrictive diet. For those with medically intractable epilepsy or those in whom surgery is unsuitable, a ketogenic diet could improve seizure control, but tolerability is poor. One observational study suggested that the Atkins diet may have a similar effect on seizure control, but this requires more investigation."," There is insufficient evidence to recommend ketogenic diet as a substitute for ketamine for other ketogenic diets, or to support ketamine as an alternative to ketamine in terms of reduced frequency of seizures. Further research is needed to determine the optimal diet and the optimal dosage and timing of ketamine, and to compare ketogenic and ketamine with ketamine.","<study> <population> Fifty-one children, aged 1 to 8 years, with more than 10 seizures per week, whose electroencephalogram showed generalized epileptiform abnormalities or multifocal spikes, and who had failed results when taking at least 2 appropriate anti-epileptic drugs <sep> 51 children with intractable seizures who were treated with the ketogenic diet <sep> Patients were enrolled from the clinical practices of 7 sites </population> </study> <study> <population> Mean age was 3 years (range, 7 months to 6.5 years <sep> pediatric epilepsy patients with gastrostomy feeding <sep> Twelve children with static encephalopathy and intractable symptomatic epilepsy <sep> children with intractable seizures </population> </study> <study> <population> adults with refractory epilepsy <sep> Eligible subjects were 18-45 years old with at least two monthly focal seizures (with or without secondary generalization) documented by 8 weeks' follow-up <sep> Nine patients were enrolled (average age 28+/-6 years;

150, Cervical manipulation and mobilisation produced similar changes. Either may provide immediate- or short-term change; no long-term data are available. Thoracic manipulation may improve pain and function. Optimal techniques and dose are unresolved. Further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate.," Headache training appears to have a beneficial effect on pain intensity and function in the short-term, but its effects are not clear in the long-term. The results of this review suggest that there is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of headache training as an adjunct to chiropractic therapy.

160," The included studies provide strong evidence for increased ferritin and transferrin saturation levels, together with a small increase in haemoglobin, in patients with CKD who were treated with IV iron compared with oral iron. From a limited body of evidence, we identified a significant reduction in ESA requirements in patients treated with IV iron, and found no significant difference in mortality. Adverse effects were reported in only 50% of included studies. We therefore suggest that further studies that focus on patient-centred outcomes are needed to determine if the use of IV iron is justified on the basis of reductions in ESA dose and cost, improvements in patient quality of life, and with few serious adverse effects."," Iron supplementation is associated with a reduction in the incidence of adverse events, but no significant difference in mortality. Iron supplementation does not appear to have a significant impact on mortality or morbidity. However, iron supplementation does appear to be associated with an increase in iron consumption, although there is no evidence of a significant difference between iron supplementation and iron supplementation alone or in combination with iron supplementation. Further research is needed to determine the best iron supplementation regimen and the optimal iron composition and timing of iron supplementation, and to compare iron supplementation to iron supplementation with other iron supplements.","<study> <population> 39 iron-deficient uremics starting hemodialysis <sep> hemodialyzed patients <sep> Nine patients (control group) had no iron

161," From this review, we conclude that when diabetes duration is over one year, the overall effect of self-monitoring of blood glucose on glycaemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes who are not using insulin is small up to six months after initiation and subsides after 12 months.

164," GTR has a greater effect on probing measures of periodontal treatment than open flap debridement, including improved attachment gain, reduced pocket depth, less increase in gingival recession and more gain in hard tissue probing at re-entry surgery. However there is marked variability between studies and the clinical relevance of these changes is unknown. As a result, it is difficult to draw general conclusions about the clinical benefit of GTR. Whilst there is evidence that GTR can demonstrate a significant improvement over conventional open flap surgery, the factors affecting outcomes are unclear from the literature and these might include study conduct issues such as bias. Therefore, patients and health professionals need to consider the predictability of the technique compared with other methods of treatment before making final decisions on use. Since trial reports were often incomplete, we recommend that future trials should follow the CONSORT statement both in their conduct and reporting. There is therefore little value in future research repeating simple, small efficacy studies. The priority should be to identify factors associated with improved outcomes as well as investigating outcomes relevant to patients. Types of research might include large observational studies to generate hypotheses for testing in clinical trials, qualitative studies on patient-centred outcomes and trials exploring innovative analytic methods such as multilevel modelling. Open flap surgery should remain the control comparison in these studies."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the existence of a protective mechanism to protect against PPD reduction in the developing world.

165," Although antibiotic treatment is effective for children with UTI, there are insufficient data to answer the question of which type of antibiotic or which duration is most effective to treat symptomatic lower UTI. This review found that 10-day antibiotic treatment is more likely to eliminate bacteria from the urine than single-dose treatments. No differences were observed for persistent bacteriuria, recurrence or re-infection between short and long-course antibiotics where the antibiotic differed between groups. This data adds to an existing Cochrane review comparing short and long-course treatment of the same antibiotic who also reported no evidence of difference between short and long-course antibiotics."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the effectiveness of antibiotic therapy in the treatment of uncomplicated UTIs. Further research is needed to determine the effectiveness and safety of antibiotic treatment in this population, as well as to compare antibiotic therapy with no treatment or no treatment. Finally, there is a need for a well-designed, well-conducted, transparent and reported randomised controlled trial comparing antibiotic therapy to antibiotic therapy alone or in combination.","<study>

167," This review shows a trend towards greater effectiveness with dual chamber pacing compared to single chamber ventricular pacing, which supports the current British Pacing and Electrophysiology Group's Guidelines regarding atrioventricular block. Additional randomised controlled trial evidence from ongoing trials in this area will further inform the debate."," The results of this review suggest that there is no evidence to support or refute the use of DDDIR as a measure of cardiac output. However, the results are based on a small number of small studies with a high risk of bias and are therefore not necessarily representative of the whole range of outcomes measured in this review.

174," Overall, we found neither evidence that the addition of pTE to antineoplastic treatment reduced the risk of death or disease progression nor that it improved the rate of tumour responses to antineoplastic treatment. For thymosin α1, there was a trend for a reduced risk of dying and of improved DFS. There was preliminary evidence that pTE lowered the risk of severe infectious complications in patients undergoing chemotherapy or radiotherapy."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of thymosuppression in the treatment of T cell carcinoma.

177," At the moment there is no evidence from individual RCTs in children and adults with different malignancies that underscores the use of an LBD for the prevention of infection and related outcomes. All studies differed with regard to co-interventions, outcome definitions, and intervention and control diets. Since pooling of results was not possible and all studies had serious methodological limitations, no definitive conclusions can be made. It should be noted that 'no evidence of effect', as identified in this review, is not the same as 'evidence of no effect'. Based on the currently available evidence, we are not able to give recommendations for clinical practice. More high-quality research is needed."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of antibiotics in the treatment of febrile neutropenia. Further randomized controlled trials are needed to determine whether antibiotics are beneficial or harmful in terms of reducing mortality and morbidity, and to assess the effectiveness of antibiotic therapy in this population.

180," Oral or intravenous furosemide cannot be recommended as treatment for transient tachypnoea of the newborn and it should not be used unless additional data become available. This finding suggests that either furosemide is not effective in promoting resorption of lung fluid, or factors other than delayed resorption of this fluid contribute to the pathogenesis of transient tachypnoea of the newborn.

195," People with mild, moderate or severe dementia due to Alzheimer's disease treated for periods of 12, 24 or 52 weeks with donepezil experienced benefits in cognitive function, activities of daily living and behaviour. Study clinicians rated global clinical state more positively in treated patients, and measured less decline in measures of global disease severity. There is some evidence that use of donepezil is neither more nor less expensive compared with placebo when assessing total health care resource costs. Benefits on the 10 mg/day dose were marginally larger than on the 5 mg/day dose. Taking into consideration the better tolerability of the 5 mg/day donepezil compared with the 10 mg/day dose, together with the lower cost, the lower dose may be the better option. The debate on whether donepezil is effective continues despite the evidence of efficacy from the clinical studies because the treatment effects are small and are not always apparent in practice."," Cognitive performance tests are effective in reducing caregiver stress and improving caregiver competence in the short-term. Cognitive performance test results are similar to those of other cognitive performance tests. However, the results are based on a small number of small studies with a high risk of bias and a low risk of random errors. The quality of the evidence is low and the results do not indicate a significant difference in quality of life or caregiver satisfaction with cognitive performance test. Cognitive tests are also not significantly different from those of the control group. Positive findings of Cognitive Performance tests are similar in severity and severity of dementia, but cognitive tests are significantly more likely to be accurate than negative findings. Positive results of cognitive Performance tests should be interpreted with caution, as the results of these studies were based on only one study, and therefore the results cannot be extrapolated to all other cognitive tests. Cognitive Performance test results should be viewed with caution as the majority of the studies were conducted in Japan, where cognitive performance scores were similar to that of most of the other tests included in this review. The results of this review suggest that Cognitive Performance Tests may be useful in determining the level of cognitive performance testing in Alzheimer's Disease, but there is a need for further research.","<study> <population> patients with early-stage Alzheimer disease <sep> enrolled patients with early-stage Alzheimer disease <sep> early-stage Alzheimer disease </population> </study> <study> <population> patients with Alzheimer disease <sep> patients with AD <sep> mild to moderately severe Alzheimer disease (AD </population> </study> <study> <population> patients with mild to moderately severe Alzheimer's disease (AD <sep> Eight hundred and eighteen patients with mild to moderately severe AD <sep> patients with mild to moderately severe AD </population> </study> <study> <population> patients with moderate to severe AD <sep> Two hundred ninety patients with moderate to severe AD (baseline standardized Mini-Mental State Examination score of 5-17 <sep> patients with moderate to severe Alzheimer's disease (AD <sep> patients with moderate to severe Alzheimer's disease and the effect on caregiver burden <sep> Patients resided in the community or in assisted living facilities who did not require skilled 24-hour nursing care </population> </study> <study> <population> Japan <sep> 268 patients were enrolled and 39 of these (15%) were withdrawn <sep> patients with mild to moderately severe Alzheimer's disease for 24 weeks in a double-blind <sep> patients with Alzheimer's disease <sep> patients with mild to moderately severe Alzheimer's disease </population> </study> <study> <population> SD age, 75.0+/-9.5 years) with probable Alzheimer disease and scores of 20 or less on the information-memory-concentration subscale of the Blessed Dementia Scale <sep> Alzheimer disease in patients drawn from clinical practice <sep> patients with Alzheimer disease who are encountered in clinical practice <sep> Memory disorders units at Massachusetts General and Brigham and Women's hospitals, Boston <sep> Sixty individuals (30 men and 30 women;

199," Inhaled antibiotic treatment probably improves lung function and reduces exacerbation rate, but a pooled estimate of the level of benefit is not possible. The best evidence is for inhaled tobramycin. More evidence, from trials of longer duration, is needed to determine whether this benefit is maintained and to determine the significance of development of antibiotic-resistant organisms."," Antibiotic prophylaxis is effective in improving lung function in patients with a P. aeruginosa infection. However, there is a need for further well-designed randomized controlled trials to evaluate the effects of prophylephrine injection on lung function and quality of life. Such trials are needed to determine the optimal dose, duration and duration of therapy, as well as to assess the effectiveness of the combination therapy in reducing lung function.","<study>

200," Evidence suggests that risperidone and olanzapine are useful in reducing aggression and risperidone reduces psychosis, but both are associated with serious adverse cerebrovascular events and extrapyramidal symptoms. Despite the modest efficacy, the significant increase in adverse events confirms that neither risperidone nor olanzapine should be used routinely to treat dementia patients with aggression or psychosis unless there is severe distress or risk of physical harm to those living and working with the patient. Although insufficient data were available from the considered trials, a meta-analysis of seventeen placebo controlled trials of atypical neuroleptics for the treatment of behavioural symptoms in people with dementia conducted by the Food and Drug Administration suggested a significant increase in mortality (OR 1.7). A peer-reviewed meta-analysis (Schneider 2005) of 15 placebo controlled studies (nine unpublished) found similarly increased risk in mortality (OR=1.54, 95% CI 0.004 to 0.02, p=0.01) for the atypical neuroleptics."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of glucocorticoids in the treatment of agitation, agitation or psychosis in people with Alzheimer's disease. Further research is needed to establish the effectiveness of these drugs in treating agitation and agitation in these patients, as well as to assess the effects on other outcomes, such as psychological wellbeing and quality of life.

201," Behavioral interventions reduce self-reported unprotected anal sex among MSM. These results indicate that HIV prevention for this population can work and should be supported. Results of previous studies provide a benchmark for expectations in new studies. Meta-analysis can inform future design and implementation in terms of sample size, target populations, settings, goals for process measures, and intervention content. When effects differ by design variables, which are deliberately selected and planned, awareness of these characteristics may be beneficial to future designs. Researchers designing future small group and individual-level studies should keep in mind that to date, effects of the greatest magnitude have been observed in studies that used count outcomes and a shorter intervention span (up to 1 month). Among small group and individual-level studies, effects were also greatest when the comparison condition included minimal to no HIV prevention content. Nevertheless, statistically significant favorable effects were also seen when the comparison condition included standard or other HIV prevention content. Researchers choosing the latter option for new studies should plan for larger sample sizes based on the smaller expected net intervention effect noted above. When effects differ by implementation variables, which become evident as the study is conducted but are not usually selected or planned, caution may be advised so that future studies can reduce bias. Because intervention effects were somewhat stronger (though not statistically significantly so) in studies with a greater attrition in the comparison condition, differential retention may be a threat to validity. Extra effort should be given to retaining participants in comparison conditions. Among community-level interventions, intervention effects were strongest among studies with random assignment of groups or communities. Therefore the inclusion of studies where assignment of groups or communities was by convenience did not exaggerate the summary effect. The greater effectiveness of interventions including more than 25% non-gay identifying MSM suggests that when they can be reached, these men may be more responsive than gay-identified men to risk reduction efforts. Non-gay identified MSM may have had less exposure to previous prevention messages, so their initial exposure may have a greater impact. The greater effectiveness of interventions that include efforts to promote personal skills such as keeping condoms available and behavioral self-management indicates that such content merits strong consideration in development and delivery of new interventions for MSM. And the finding that interventions were most effective for majority white populations underscores the critical need for effective interventions for MSM of African and Latino descent. Further research measuring the incidence of HIV and other STDs is needed. Because most studies were conducted among mostly white men in the US and Europe, more evaluations of interventions are needed for African American and Hispanic MSM as well as MSM in the developing world. More research is also needed to further clarify which behavioral strategies (e.g., reducing unprotected anal sex, having oral sex instead of anal sex, reducing number of partners, avoiding serodiscordant partners, strategic positioning, or reducing anal sex even with condom use) are most effective in reducing transmission among MSM, the messages most effective in promoting these behaviors, and the methods and settings in which these messages can be most effectively delivered."," Sexual risk behaviours are significantly reduced with the use of social support and psychological support. Sexual support appears to be effective in reducing sexual risk behaviours, but its effectiveness is not clear from this review. Positive effects on sexual risk behaviors are likely to be sustained over time, but this is unlikely to translate into a reduction in sexual risk behaviour. Positive results from social support are unlikely to have an immediate impact on sexual risks behaviours. Positive findings from the review suggest that social support may be beneficial for reducing sexual risks behaviors, but further research is needed to assess the effects of this intervention.","<study> <population> Latino gay and bisexual men (LGBM <sep> Latino gay and bisexual men <sep> New York City in which 180 LGBM </population> </study> <study> <population> urban gay and bisexual men <sep> 162 methamphetamine-dependent (SCID-verified) GBM in Los Angeles County <sep> dependent gay and bisexual men (GBM </population> </study> <study> <population> anonymous testing site in San Francisco, California, between May 1997 and January 2000 <sep> Participants were 248 MSM with a history of at least one previous negative HIV test result and self-reported UAI (receptive or insertive) in the previous 12 months with partners of unknown or discordant HIV status <sep> men who have sex with men (MSM) and among men with a history of repeat testing for HIV <sep> HIV-negative men <sep> gay male repeat testers for HIV </population> </study> <study> <population> Gay men (n=92) who had slipped up kept diaries of their sexual behaviour for 16 weeks </population> </study> <study> <population> gay men <sep> Men (n = 109) who had'slipped up' (broken their safe sex rules by having unprotected anal intercourse) kept diaries of their sexual behaviour for 16 weeks </population> </study> <study> <population> men who have sex with men <sep> HIV-negative men who have sex with men (MSM;

202, Therapeutic aspiration in addition to metronidazole to hasten clinical or radiologic resolution of uncomplicated amoebic liver abscesses cannot be supported or refuted by the present evidence.

203," The range of proven effective interventions for chronic pelvic pain remains limited and recommendations are based largely on single studies. Given the prevalence and healthcare costs associated with chronic pelvic pain in women, randomised controlled trials of other medical, surgical and psychological interventions are urgently required.Chronic pelvic pain is common in women in the reproductive and older age groups and it causes disability and distress that result in significant costs to health services. The pathogenesis of chronic pelvic pain is poorly understood. Often investigation by laparoscopy reveals no obvious cause for the pain. There are several possible explanations for chronic pelvic pain including undetected irritable bowel syndrome, and central sensitisation of the nervous system. A vascular hypothesis proposes that pain arises from dilated pelvic veins in which blood flow is markedly reduced. As the pathophysiology of chronic pelvic pain is not well understood, its treatment is often unsatisfactory and limited to symptom relief. Currently the main approaches to treatment include counselling or psychotherapy, attempts to provide reassurance using laparoscopy to exclude serious pathology, progestogen therapy such as with medroxyprogesterone acetate and surgery to interrupt nerve pathways."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of acupuncture for pain relief in women with pelvic pain. Further research is needed to determine the effectiveness of acupuncture in the treatment of pelvic pain, and to compare acupuncture with other treatments. Finally, there is a need for a meta-analysis of pain relief for women with chronic pain, as well as a comparison of acupuncture with placebo or no treatment.","<study> <population> Twenty percent of

204," There is insufficient evidence of efficacy of individual antioxidants, or antioxidants in general, in the treatment of people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. One study reported a mild positive effect but this was not supported in our analysis. If future trials of antioxidant medications are performed, careful attention should be given to sample size, outcome measures, and duration of the trials. The high tolerance and safety, and relatively low cost of vitamins C and E, explain the continuing use of these vitamins by physicians and people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.

206," Cyproterone acetate combined with estradiol results in a subjective improvement in hirsutism compared to placebo. Clinical differences in outcome between cyproterone acetate and other medical therapies were not demonstrated in the studies included in this review.

208, There are few trials that have directly compared the antipyretic properties of paracetamol against placebo or physical methods. Data on adverse events are limited. Establishing standard outcomes will help comparisons between studies and better meta-analysis.," Antipyretic drugs are effective in reducing fever severity and duration of treatment, but there is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of these drugs in the treatment of feverish children with malaria.

Finally, there is a need for further research into the effectiveness and safety of photocagulation for myopia, as well as to compare the effectiveness of these approaches to other methods of optical manipulation, such as binocular tomography.","<study> <population> myopia in a random population of children who are known to be very susceptible to myopia <sep> children <sep> 48 myopic children, aged six to 15 years </population> </study> <study> <population> Ninety-six patients were evaluated, 32 in each group <sep> myopia </population> </study> <study> <population> schoolchildren <sep> Two hundred and forty mildly myopic schoolchildren aged 9-11 years </population> </study> <study> <population> myopia in a treatment group of 138 (121 retained) subjects wearing progressive lenses (PAL; add +1.50 D) and in a control group of 160 (133 retained) subjects wearing single vision lenses (SV <sep> Hong Kong children between the ages of 7 and 10.5 years </population> </study> <study> <population> children were recruited at four colleges of optometry in the United States and were ethnically diverse <sep> 469 children (mean age at baseline, 9.3 <sep> myopia in children <sep> COMET enrolled 469 children (ages 6-11 years) with myopia between -1.25 and -4.50 D spherical equivalent </population> </study> <study> <population> 178 Chinese juvenile-onset acquired myopes (aged 7-13 years, -0.50 to -3.00 <sep> One hundred and forty-nine subjects (75 in SV and 74 in PAL) completed the 2-year study <sep> Chinese children </population> </study> <study> <population> school age children <sep> 6 through 12 years of age with myopia between -1 and -4 diopters, astigmatism <or= 2 diopters, no prior contact lens wear, no other ocular pathologies <sep> 428 Singaporean children <sep> children's myopia </population> </study> <study> <population> children with myopia <sep> school-aged children <sep> healthy children, aged 8 to 12 years, with a spherical equivalent of -0.75 to -4.00 diopters (D) and astigmatism of 1.00 D or less </population> </study> <study> <population> 46 children in that study who completed 54 months of followup <sep> myopic children with esophoria <sep> children with near-point esophoria </population> </study> <study> <population> Thirty-two children, all with near point esophoria <sep> Twenty-eight children completed the study </population> </study> <study> <population> Three hundred fifty-three healthy children, 6 to 12 years old, with a spherical equivalent (SE) of -0.75 to -4.00 diopters (D) and astigmatism of <or=1.00 D.

225," Generally, fluoroquinolones performed well in treating typhoid, and maybe superior to alternatives in some settings. However, we were unable to draw firm general conclusions on comparative contemporary effectiveness given that resistance changes over time, and many studies were small. Policy makers and clinicians need to consider local resistance patterns in choosing a fluoroquinolone or alternative. There is some evidence that the newest fluoroquinolone, gatifloxacin, remains effective in some regions where resistance to older fluoroquinolones has developed. However, the different fluoroquinolones have not been compared directly in trials in these settings."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of azathioprine as a substitute for ampicillin in the treatment of people with malaria. Further research is needed to determine the optimal dose and duration of amicillin, the optimal duration of antibiotic therapy, and the optimal dosage and timing of therapy. In addition, future trials should evaluate the effectiveness and safety of these drugs, as well as the duration of treatment, and to compare these drugs with each other.","<study> <population> 123

226," The evidence suggests that a discharge plan tailored to the individual patient probably brings about reductions in hospital length of stay and readmission rates for older people admitted to hospital with a medical condition. The impact of discharge planning on mortality, health outcomes and cost remains uncertain."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the existence of a mechanism by which healthcare professionals can improve the quality of healthcare services provided to patients in hospital. Further research is needed to establish the effectiveness of this mechanism, and to assess its effectiveness in terms of reducing mortality and health service utilization, improving quality of life

Finally, there is a need for an assessment of the effectiveness of selective grafting as an alternative to open clamping in terms of reduced blood loss and mortality.","<study> <population> Between

236," Although antibiotic treatment is effective for the cure of urinary tract infections, there are insufficient data to recommend any specific drug regimen for treatment of symptomatic urinary tract infections during pregnancy. All the antibiotics studied were shown to be very effective in decreasing the incidence of the different outcomes. Complications were very rare.

237, Metered-dose inhalers with spacer produced outcomes that were at least equivalent to nebuliser delivery. Spacers may have some advantages compared to nebulisers for children with acute asthma.," Salbutamol is effective in reducing the incidence of pulmonary embolisms in patients with acute asthma. It is also associated with a reduction in the risk of pneumothorax, a decreased risk of respiratory distress syndrome, and an increased risk of hypoxaemia. However, these results are based on only a small number of patients and are not representative of the whole range of treatments available in this review. Further research is needed to determine the optimal dose and duration of salbutamnol and its use in patients who are at high risk of complications.","<study> <population> 44 asthmatic patients who

238, A comparison of the effects of human and animal insulin as well as of the adverse reaction profile did not show clinically relevant differences. Many patient-oriented outcomes like health-related quality of life or diabetes complications and mortality were never investigated in high-quality randomised clinical trials. The story of the introduction of human insulin might be repeated by contemporary launching campaigns to introduce pharmaceutical and technological innovations that are not backed up by sufficient proof of their advantages and safety.," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of human insulin in the treatment of hypoglycaemia. Further research is needed to identify the optimal insulin dose and duration, and to evaluate the effectiveness of human insulins in this population. Finally, there is a need for further research into the efficacy and safety of animal insulin in reducing blood glucose levels in humans and animals.","<study> <population> type 1 diabetic patients

241," While brief counselling interventions have been identified as successful ifor adults when delivered by physicians, this cannot be extrapolated to adults as parents in child health settings. However, there is limited support for more intensive counselling interventions for parents in such contexts. There is no clear evidence of differences between the respiratory, non-respiratory ill child, well child and peripartum settings as contexts for reduction of children's ETS exposure."," There is insufficient evidence to recommend or refute the use of any particular type of intervention for the prevention of ETS in mothers or children. Further research is needed to identify the most effective intervention and the best way to tailor it to the needs of the mother or child, and to compare the effectiveness of different types of intervention in different populations and settings.","<study> <population> counselling mothers on their children's exposure to environmental tobacco smoke <sep> smoking mothers in reducing young

Its efficacy is similar to that of salmeterol, but with a lower risk of pneumonia and an increased risk of bronchodilator toxicity.

244," Antibiotics covering aerobic and aerobic bacteria should be delivered orally and intravenously prior to colorectal surgery. Antibiotics delivered within this framework will reduce the risk of postoperative SWI by at least 75%. Further research is required to establish the optimal timing and duration of dosing, and frequency of longer-term adverse effects such as Clostridium difficile pseudomembranous colitis."," Antibiotic prophylaxis is effective in reducing the incidence of bacterial contamination in the first two weeks after surgery. However, there is a need for further research to evaluate the effectiveness of antibiotic prothylaxis in this population, and to compare the effectiveness and safety of different antibiotic regimens. Finally, to determine the optimal antibiotic regimen, the optimal dose and duration of antibiotic treatment, and the optimal dosage and timing of antibiotic therapy, we recommend that all patients receive an appropriate amount of antibiotics to avoid bacterial contamination.","<study> <population> elective colorectal surgery <sep> 157 patients undergoing elective colorectal surgery

246," Available evidence nevertheless suggests that compared with standard care or no intervention, behavioral interventions are effective in reducing HIV and the incidence of STIs amongst female sex workers (FSWs). Given the benefits of social cognitive theory and the promotion of condom use in reducing HIV/STI and the public health need to control transmission amongst FSWs, there is a clear finding in favour of behavioral interventions.

248," Although numerous studies have been undertaken, there is a noticeable inconsistency of the findings of the available studies and this is confounded by serious methodological issues within the included studies. The body of evidence in this review does not support the hypothesis that multi-component community wide interventions effectively increase population levels of physical activity. There is a clear need for well-designed intervention studies and such studies should focus on the quality of the measurement of physical activity, the frequency of measurement and the allocation to intervention and control communities."," Physical activity programmes are effective in lowering blood pressure and reducing triglycerides in physical activity programmes. Physical activity programs are associated with a reduction in triglycerides and LDL-cholesterol levels. Physical activities programmes are also associated with an increase in triglyceride levels and triglycerides levels. Exercise programmes may be associated with reduced triglycerides, but there is no evidence of an effect on triglycerides or cholesterol levels in physical activities programmes. Exercise programs may reduce triglycerides but there are insufficient data to assess the effects of exercise programmes on blood pressure, cholesterol levels or triglycerides.","<study> <population>

249," Benefits of screening include a modest reduction in colorectal cancer mortality, a possible reduction in cancer incidence through the detection and removal of colorectal adenomas, and potentially, the less invasive surgery that earlier treatment of colorectal cancers may involve.Harmful effects of screening include the psycho-social consequences of receiving a false-positive result, the potentially significant complications of colonoscopy or a false-negative result, the possibility of overdiagnosis (leading to unnecessary investigations or treatment) and the complications associated with treatment."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the existence of a protective effect of immunosuppressive agents on mortality from CRC.

251," There appears to be little basis for offering CSE over epidurals in labour, with no difference in overall maternal satisfaction despite a slightly faster onset with CSE and conversely less pruritus with low-dose epidurals. There was no difference in ability to mobilise, maternal hypotension, rate of caesarean birth or neonatal outcome. However, the significantly higher incidence of urinary retention, rescue interventions and instrumental deliveries with traditional techniques would favour the use of low-dose epidurals.

255," The results of this systematic review indicate that virtual reality endoscopy training can be used to effectively supplement early conventional endoscopy training (apprenticeship model) in diagnostic oesophagogastroduodenoscopy, colonoscopy and/or sigmoidoscopy for health professions trainees with limited or no prior endoscopic experience. However, there remains insufficient evidence to advise for or against the use of virtual reality simulation-based training as a replacement for early conventional endoscopy training (apprenticeship model) for health professions trainees with limited or no prior endoscopic experience.

256," The findings of this review suggest that oral naltrexone did not perform better than treatment with placebo or no pharmacological agent with respect to the number of participants re-incarcerated during the study period. If oral naltrexone is compared with other pharmacological treatments such as benzodiazepine and buprenorphine, no statistically significant difference was found. The percentage of people retained in treatment in the included studies is however low (28%). The conclusion of this review is that the studies conducted have not allowed an adequate evaluation of oral naltrexone treatment in the field of opioid dependence. Consequently, maintenance therapy with naltrexone cannot yet be considered a treatment which has been scientifically proved to be superior to other kinds of treatment."," There is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of naltrexone for the treatment of relapse or relapse of heroin dependence. Further research is needed to assess the efficacy and safety of Naltrexones for relapse and relapse, and to compare the effectiveness of NALTrexone with other antidepressants, and also to assess its efficacy in relapse.

270," As a result of the few available studies, no convincing conclusions can be formulated about the effectiveness of workplace interventions on work-related outcomes and health outcomes regardless of the type of work disability. The pooled data for the musculoskeletal disorders subgroup indicated that workplace interventions are effective in the reduction of sickness absence, but they are not effective in improving health outcomes. The evidence from the subgroup analysis on musculoskeletal disorders was rated as moderate-quality evidence. Unfortunately, conclusions cannot be drawn on the effectiveness of these interventions for mental health problems and other health conditions due to a lack of studies."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the effectiveness of workplace ergonomic interventions for improving worker satisfaction and productivity. Workplace ergonomic training may improve worker satisfaction, productivity and satisfaction with work, but there is a need for further research.

271," The quantity and especially quality of data are low. Analysis shows a reduction in overall complications, but major complications were not reduced. Length of stay was reduced significantly. We state that ERAS seems safe, but the quality of trials and lack of sufficient other outcome parameters do not justify implementation of ERAS as the standard of care. Within ERAS protocols included, no answer regarding the role for minimally invasive surgery (i.e. laparoscopy) was found. Furthermore, protocol compliance within ERAS programs has not been investigated, while this seems a known problem in the field. Therefore, more specific and large RCT's are needed."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of epidural analgesia for post-operative complications. Further research is needed to determine the optimal dose and duration of epidurals for postoperative complications, and to assess the effectiveness of the various analgesia in terms of pain relief, function, fatigue, sleepiness, fatigue and sleepiness. Finally, to evaluate the efficacy of intraoperative analgesia compared to epidural anaesthesia alone or in combination with other analgesia, to compare the effectiveness and safety of epiduran

272," ESA treatment in cancer patients increased on study mortality and worsened overall survival. For patients undergoing chemotherapy the increase was less pronounced, but an adverse effect could not be excluded."," Red blood cell transfusion does not appear to have a significant effect on survival or quality of life in patients with advanced cancer receiving chemotherapy. However, it does appear to reduce the risk of death and the need for transfusion in these patients. Red blood cells transfusion is associated with a reduction in the incidence of adverse events, including blood transfusion-related deaths, and a decrease in blood transfusions-related mortality. Red-blood transfusion therapy appears to be associated with an increased risk of infection and a decreased risk of transfusion failure, but the exact extent of this risk is unclear.","<study>

273," Use of either doxycycline 200 mg or azithromycin 500 mg by mouth before IUD insertion confers little benefit.

274," Methotrexate may have a small steroid sparing effect in adults with asthma who are dependent on oral corticosteroids.

280," Implications for practice Oral borage oil and evening primrose oil lack effect on eczema; improvement was similar to respective placebos used in trials. Oral BO and EPO are not effective treatments for eczema. In these studies, along with the placebos, EPO and BO have the same, fairly common, mild, transient adverse effects, which are mainly gastrointestinal. The short-term studies included here do not examine possible adverse effects of long-term use of EPO or BO. A case report warned that if EPO is taken for a prolonged period of time (more than one year), there is a potential risk of inflammation, thrombosis, and immunosuppression; another study found that EPO may increase bleeding for people on Coumadin® (warfarin) medication.

281," Longitudinal studies consistently suggest that exposure to tobacco advertising and promotion is associated with the likelihood that adolescents will start to smoke. Based on the strength and specificity of this association, evidence of a dose-response relationship, the consistency of findings across numerous observational studies, temporality of exposure and smoking behaviours observed, as well as the theoretical plausibility regarding the impact of advertising, we conclude that tobacco advertising and promotion increases the likelihood that adolescents will start to smoke."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the existence of a positive effect of media ads on smoking risk factors in children and adolescents.

283," Stapled hemorrhoidopexy is associated with a higher long-term risk of hemorrhoid recurrence and the symptom of prolapse. It is also associated with a higher likelihood of long-term symptom recurrence and the need for additional operations compared to conventional excisional hemorrhoid surgeries. Patients should be informed of these risks when being offered the stapled hemorrhoidopexy as surgical therapy. If hemorrhoid recurrence and prolapse are the most important clinical outcomes, then conventional excisional surgery remains the ""gold standard"" in the surgical treatment of internal hemorrhoids."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of any of the recommended analgesic agents in the treatment of postoperative pain relief in terms of reduction in blood loss, reduction in prolapse recurrence, and improvement in quality of life compared to standard anaesthesia. Further research is needed to determine the optimal analgesic regime and the optimal dosage and duration of analgesia, and to compare different analgesic regimens and dosage schedules.","<study>

284," We cannot make any definite statements on the efficacy and clinical usefulness of electrotherapy modalities for neck pain. Since the quality of evidence is low or very low, we are uncertain about the estimate of the effect. Further research is very likely to change both the estimate of effect and our confidence in the results. Current evidence for PEMF, rMS, and TENS shows that these modalities might be more effective than placebo but not other interventions. Funding bias should be considered, especially in PEMF studies. Galvanic current, iontophoresis, electric muscle stimulation(EMS), and static magnetic field did not reduce pain or disability. Future trials on these interventions should have larger patient samples and include more precise standardization and description of all treatment characteristics."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of TENS in the treatment of neck pain. Further research is needed to identify the optimal TENS regime, the optimal intensity and duration of TES, and the best way to deliver TENS to people with chronic pain. Finally, there is a need for further evaluation of the effectiveness of Tens in chronic pain, and to compare TENS with other forms of pain management.","<study> <population> osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee and cervical spine <sep> 86 patients with OA of the knee and 81 patients with OA of the cervical spine, in which pain was evaluated using a 10 cm visual analog scale, activities of daily living using a series of questions (answered by the patient as never, sometimes, most of the time, or always), pain on passive motion (recorded as none, slight, moderate, or severe), and joint tenderness (recorded using a modified Ritchie scale <sep> osteoarthritis of the knee and cervical spine </population> </study> <study> <population> cervical osteoarthritis <sep> patients with cervical osteoarthritis (COA <sep> Thirty-four patients with COA </population> </study> <study> <population> chronic neck pain patients <sep> patients with chronic neck pain <sep> Two hundred and eighteen patients with chronic neck pain </population> </study> <study> <population> 40 patients entering the study received active PEMT collars: the other half <sep> acute whiplash injuries <sep> acute whiplash syndrome </population> </study> <study> <population> 101 volunteers, 46 males and 55 females <sep> neck and shoulder pain <sep> 4 divided groups (with pain vs without pain matched with magnetic vs nonmagnetic necklace </population> </study> <study> <population> Thirty patients with acute cervical pain </population> </study> <study> <population> myofascial pain syndrome <sep> Forty subjects with upper trapezius MPS <sep> Myofascial pain syndrome (MPS </population> </study> <study> <population> myofascial pain syndrome <sep> subjects with myofascial trigger points (TPs) at the level of the superior trapezius muscle </population> </study> <study> <population> Inclusion criteria were as follows: either clinically verified painful lumbar radiculopathy in the segments L5/S1 and a Laségue's sign of 30 degrees (or more), or typical signs of the whiplash syndrome such as painful restriction of rotation and flexion/extension <sep> 100 patients with lumbar radiculopathy and 92 with the whiplash syndrome <sep> patients with lumbar radiculopathy or the whiplash syndrome <sep> patients with either lumbar radiculopathy in the segments L5/S1 or the whiplash syndrome </population> </study> <study> <population> Sixty patients (25 males and 35 females) who had myofascial trigger points in one side of the upper trapezius muscles were studied </population> </study> <study> <population> One hundred nineteen subjects with palpably active myofascial trigger points (MTrPs <sep> Copyright 2002 by the American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine and the American Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation </population> </study> <study> <population> myofascial pain syndrome <sep> Eighteen patients who presented with myofascial trigger points (TPs) at the level of the superior trapezius </population> </study> <study> <population> 20 patients <sep> 20 patients with persistent (greater than 8 weeks) neck pain <sep> persistent neck pain <sep> patients with neck pain </population> </study>","<study> <interventions> pulsed electromagnetic fields (PEMF <sep> placebo <sep> PEMF <sep> pulsed electromagnetic fields </interventions> </study> <study> <interventions> electromagnetic field therapy (PEMF <sep> placebo <sep> PEMF <sep> pulsed electromagnetic fields </interventions> </study> <study> <interventions> TENS <sep> acupuncture points plus infrared irradiation (TENS group);

294," If we assume that screening reduces breast cancer mortality by 15% and that overdiagnosis and overtreatment is at 30%, it means that for every 2000 women invited for screening throughout 10 years, one will avoid dying of breast cancer and 10 healthy women, who would not have been diagnosed if there had not been screening, will be treated unnecessarily. Furthermore, more than 200 women will experience important psychological distress including anxiety and uncertainty for years because of false positive findings. To help ensure that the women are fully informed before they decide whether or not to attend screening, we have written an evidence-based leaflet for lay people that is available in several languages on www.cochrane.dk. Because of substantial advances in treatment and greater breast cancer awareness since the trials were carried out, it is likely that the absolute effect of screening today is smaller than in the trials. Recent observational studies show more overdiagnosis than in the trials and very little or no reduction in the incidence of advanced cancers with screening."," Screening mammography for breast cancer is associated with a reduction in the incidence of death, but a significant increase in the rate of metastatic breast cancer. Screening for breast cancers for breast screening for breast reconstruction appears to have a beneficial effect on survival and quality of life. However, there is a need for further research to assess the effects of screening on survival, quality and time to progression.","<study> <population> for breast cancer, and 55,985 women aged 40-74

298," We conclude that despite promising immunological responses no clinically effective antigen-specific active immunotherapy is yet available for ovarian cancer. Furthermore, the adoption of guidelines to ensure uniformity in trial conduct, response definitions and trial reporting is recommended to improve quality and comparability of immunotherapy trials."," Immunogenicity and immunogenicity are similar in terms of efficacy and safety. However, the risk of toxicity is higher in those receiving an immunogenetic antibody, and in those who are receiving an adjuvant vaccine. The risk of adverse events is lower with an ELISA antibody, but the number needed to treat is much higher with a ELISA vaccine. There is a need for further well-designed, well-conducted and reported randomized controlled trials to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of ELISA vaccines in humans with advanced disease.","<study>

310," Bupropion increases smoking abstinence rates in smokers with schizophrenia, without jeopardizing their mental state. Varenicline may also improve smoking cessation rates in schizophrenia, but its possible psychiatric adverse effects cannot be ruled out. CR may help this group of patients to quit and reduce smoking in the short term. We failed to find convincing evidence that other interventions have a beneficial effect on smoking in schizophrenia."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the effectiveness of psychosocial interventions for reducing smoking behaviour in psychiatric patients with schizophrenia. Further research is needed to determine the effectiveness and safety of these interventions, and to compare them to each other, and also to compare the efficacy and effectiveness of these approaches to other psychiatric therapies.

312," Prior to the current update it appeared there was some evidence that cranberry juice may decrease the number of symptomatic UTIs over a 12 month period, particularly for women with recurrent UTIs. The addition of 14 further studies suggests that cranberry juice is less effective than previously indicated. Although some of small studies demonstrated a small benefit for women with recurrent UTIs, there were no statistically significant differences when the results of a much larger study were included. Cranberry products were not significantly different to antibiotics for preventing UTIs in three small studies. Given the large number of dropouts/withdrawals from studies (mainly attributed to the acceptability of consuming cranberry products particularly juice, over long periods), and the evidence that the benefit for preventing UTI is small, cranberry juice cannot currently be recommended for the prevention of UTIs. Other preparations (such as powders) need to be quantified using standardised methods to ensure the potency, and contain enough of the 'active' ingredient, before being evaluated in clinical studies or recommended for use."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of cranberry supplements in the treatment of symptomatic UTI. There is a need for further research in this area, particularly in the context of the development of new antibiotics, and in combination with the introduction of newer antibiotics. Finally, it is important to note that cranberry supplementing is associated with an increased risk of bacterial contamination and bacterial contamination, as well as a decreased risk of

314," Despite concerns surrounding the use of opioids for long-term management of chronic LBP, there remain few high-quality trials assessing their efficacy. The trials in this review, although achieving high internal validity scores, were characterized by a lack of generalizability, inadequate description of study populations, poor intention-to treat analyses, and limited interpretation of functional improvement. Based on our results, the benefits of opioids in clinical practice for the long-term management of chronic LBP remain questionable.

315," We found strong evidence to support beneficial effects of child obesity prevention programmes on BMI, particularly for programmes targeted to children aged six to 12 years. However, given the unexplained heterogeneity and the likelihood of small study bias, these findings must be interpreted cautiously. A broad range of programme components were used in these studies and whilst it is not possible to distinguish which of these components contributed most to the beneficial effects observed, our synthesis indicates the following to be promising policies and strategies: · school curriculum that includes healthy eating, physical activity and body image · increased sessions for physical activity and the development of fundamental movement skills throughout the school week · improvements in nutritional quality of the food supply in schools · environments and cultural practices that support children eating healthier foods and being active throughout each day · support for teachers and other staff to implement health promotion strategies and activities (e.g. professional development, capacity building activities) · parent support and home activities that encourage children to be more active, eat more nutritious foods and spend less time in screen based activities However, study and evaluation designs need to be strengthened, and reporting extended to capture process and implementation factors, outcomes in relation to measures of equity, longer term outcomes, potential harms and costs. Childhood obesity prevention research must now move towards identifying how effective intervention components can be embedded within health, education and care systems and achieve long term sustainable impacts."," Dietary fruit and vegetables are effective in reducing body weight and improving physical fitness in children and adolescents. They are also associated with a reduction in BMI, BMI and triglycerides, and a decreased risk of cardiovascular disease. They also appear to have a positive effect on BMI and on triglycerides and on blood pressure. They do not appear to be associated with an increase in BMI or triglycerides. They may have a negative impact on BMI or on triglyceride levels. Their effect on body mass is not clear. Their effects on BMI are not clear from this review, but they should be viewed with caution.","<study> <population> Kindergartens (n=79 <sep> control children from non-intervention kindergartens

320," This review indicates that swimming training is well-tolerated in children and adolescents with stable asthma, and increases lung function (moderate strength evidence) and cardio-pulmonary fitness (high strength evidence).

321, This review found a beneficial effect of banding ligation on primary prevention of upper gastrointestinal bleeding in patient with oesophageal varices. The effect on bleeding did not reduce mortality. Additional evidence is needed to determine whether our results reflect that non-selective beta-blockers have other beneficial effects than on bleeding.," Prophylactic bandaging is effective in reducing the incidence of variceal hemorrhage and reducing the risk of death, but the extent to which this effect is achieved is unclear. The number needed to remove bandaging from the bandaging does not appear to be affected by the use of bandaging, but it is possible that bandaging may have a role in reducing blood loss, but this

However, there were insufficient data for reliable conclusions about the comparative effects on any of the primary outcomes for this review."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of intravenous transfusion as a means of reducing blood transfusion rates. Further research is needed to determine the best method of transfusion and the best way to administer transfusion to patients with pre-existing congenital heart defects. Finally, there is a need for further investigation of the effectiveness of transfusions as an alternative to intravenous immunoglobulins in reducing blood loss.","<study> <population> 38 women with

327," The findings of this review indicate that the number of systemic and topical drugs used for the different subforms of pruritus is increasing. Different interventions have been shown to be effective in the treatment of pruritus of different origins. Nevertheless, an optimal therapy for pruritus is constrained due to the limited understanding of crucial itch mediators and receptors in the various subforms of itch. Ideal antipruritic therapies are still lacking, especially for palliative care patients. This systematic review also indicates that there is insufficient evidence to give any concrete recommendations regarding treatment of pruritus in palliative care patients. Due to the very small sample sizes and poor methodological quality of the majority of studies that were included, the results of this review need to be interpreted with caution. Furthermore, the generalizability is questionable. Additional studies, and particularly carefully designed treatment trials, are needed to provide valid evidence for adequate treatment of pruritus in palliative care patients."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of corticosteroids in the treatment of pruritus.

328," Chemotherapy significantly improves survival in comparison to best supportive care. In addition, combination chemotherapy improves survival compared to single-agent 5-FU. All patients should be tested for their HER-2 status and trastuzumab should be added to a standard fluoropyrimidine/cisplatin regimen in patients with HER-2 positive tumours. Two and three-drug regimens including 5-FU, cisplatin, with or without an anthracycline, as well as irinotecan or docetaxel-containing regimens are reasonable treatment options for HER-2 negative patients."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of cisplatin as an adjunct to chemotherapy in terms of survival, toxicity, toxicity and survival. Further randomized controlled trials are needed to evaluate the effectiveness and toxicity profiles of these drugs in patients with advanced stages of renal toxicity. Such trials should be undertaken in accordance with the recommendations of the Cochrane Guidelines on Immunotherapy for renal toxicity in patients undergoing chemotherapy.","<study> <population>

330," Calcium antagonists reduce the risk of poor outcome and secondary ischaemia after aneurysmal SAH. The results for 'poor outcome' depend largely on a single large trial of oral nimodipine; the evidence for other calcium antagonists is inconclusive. The evidence for nimodipine is not beyond all doubt, but given the potential benefits and modest risks of this treatment, oral nimodipine is currently indicated in patients with aneurysmal SAH. Intravenous administration of calcium antagonists cannot be recommended for routine practice on the basis of the present evidence.

335," There was insufficient robust evidence from randomised trials to establish the relative effectiveness of different methods of anaesthesia, different associated physical techniques or the use of drug adjuncts in the treatment of distal radial fractures. There is, however, some indication that haematoma block provides poorer analgesia than IVRA, and can compromise reduction. Given the many unresolved questions over the management of these fractures, we suggest an integrated programme of research, which includes consideration of anaesthesia options, is the way forward."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of hydrocolloid gel as a substitute for other analgesics in the treatment of acute pain fractures.

However, the evidence of intervention effectiveness was of low to moderate quality. Trials with evidence of effectiveness included two that provided one or two sessions and three that had multiple contacts. The former had limitations, such as self-reported outcomes and showing no effect for many comparisons. The interventions with multiple sessions were promising but would have to be adapted for other locations and then retested.

Further, the size and clinical meaningfulness of statistically significant results are uncertain. However, given the risks of untreated depression in terms of completed suicide and impacts on functioning, if a decision to use medication is agreed, then fluoxetine might be the medication of first choice given guideline recommendations.

358," The results of this review suggest that phakic IOLs are safer than excimer laser surgical correction for moderate to high myopia in the range of -6.0 to -20.0 D and phakic IOLs are preferred by patients. While phakic IOLs might be accepted clinical practice for higher levels of myopia (greater than or equal to 7.0 D of myopic spherical equivalent with or without astigmatism), it may be worth considering phakic IOL treatment over excimer laser correction for more moderate levels of myopia (less than or equal to 7.0 D of myopic spherical equivalent with or without astigmatism).

361," Although there are shortcomings and gaps in the data, there appears to be enough overall consistency for different outcomes. The efficacy and adverse effects profile of penfluridol are similar to other typical antipsychotics; both oral and depot. Furthermore, penfluridol is shown to be an adequate treatment option for people with schizophrenia, especially those who do not respond to oral medication on a daily basis and do not adapt well to depot drugs. One of the results favouring penfluridol was a lower drop out rate in medium term when compared to depot medications. It is also an option for chronic sufferers of schizophrenia with residual psychotic symptoms who nevertheless need continuous use of antipsychotic medication. An additional benefit of penfluridol is that it is a low-cost intervention. Note: the eight citations in the awaiting classification section of the review may alter the conclusions of the review once assessed."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of benzodiazepines in the management of autonomic liability.

365," There was not enough evidence to judge whether or not the included drugs cured bedwetting when used alone. There was limited evidence to suggest that desmopressin, imipramine and enuresis alarms therapy were better than the included drugs to which they were compared. In other reviews, desmopressin, tricyclics and alarm interventions have been shown to be effective during treatment. There was also evidence to suggest that combination therapy with anticholinergic therapy increased the efficacy of other established therapies such as imipramine, desmopressin and enuresis alarms by reducing the relapse rates, by about 20%, although it was not possible to identify the characteristics of children who would benefit from combination therapy. Future studies should evaluate the role of combination therapy against established treatments in rigorous and adequately powered trials."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the effectiveness of hydrocolloid therapy in reducing the frequency of wet nights in humans with no known adverse effects.

369," Based on this analysis, the most prudent prescription for water intake to premature infants would seem to be careful restriction of water intake so that physiological needs are met without allowing significant dehydration.

370," Implications for practice No trials were found addressing treatment of VVC in HIV positive women.In comparison to placebo,Fluconazole was found to be an effective preventative intervention. However, the potential for resistant Candida organisms to develop might impact the feasibility of implementation. Direction of findings suggests that Clotrimazole and Lactobacillus improved the prophylactic outcomes when compared to placebo. Implications for researchThere is a need to evaluate drugs and drug regimens for VVC treatment and prophylaxis in HIV positive women through randomised clinical trials. Development of resistance to azoles remains under-studied and more work must be done in this area, so as to determine whether routine prophylaxis for VVC is at all needed or whether adequate ART would be sufficient to prevent recurrent VVC. The viral load in vaginal secretions with or without treatment or prophylaxis has not been studied, this is very relevant to the spread of HIV."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of antiviral drugs in the treatment of candidiasis.

371," Although statistically significant, the differences between disc replacement and conventional fusion surgery for degenerative disc disease were not beyond the generally accepted clinical important differences with respect to short-term pain relief, disability and Quality of Life. Moreover, these analyses only represent a highly selected population. The primary goal of prevention of adjacent level disease and facet joint degeneration by using total disc replacement, as noted by the manufacturers and distributors, was not properly assessed and not a research question at all. Unfortunately, evidence from observational studies could not be used because of the high risk of bias, while these could have improved external validity assessment of complications in less selected patient groups. Non-randomised studies should however be very clear about patient selection and should incorporate independent, blinded outcome assessment, which was not the case in the excluded studies. Therefore, because we believe that harm and complications may occur after years, we believe that the spine surgery community should be prudent about adopting this technology on a large scale, despite the fact that total disc replacement seems to be effective in treating low-back pain in selected patients, and in the short term is at least equivalent to fusion surgery."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the effectiveness of ergonomic screws for improving patient satisfaction with pain management and function in low-back pain.

372, This update of the review published in 2004 incorporates additional trials and more mature data. It demonstrates the benefit of concurrent chemoradiation over radiotherapy alone or sequential chemoradiotherapy. Patient selection is an important consideration in view of the added toxicity of concurrent treatment. Uncertainty remains as to how far this is purely due to a radiosensitising effect and whether similar benefits could be achieved by using modern radiotherapy techniques and more dose intensive accelerated and/ or hyperfractionated radiotherapy regimens.," There is no evidence to support or refute the use of chemoradoxine as a substitute for cisplatin for radiotherapy in terms of overall survival and progression-free survival. However, there is a need for further research into chemoradiotherapy in this population. In particular, there are concerns about the impact on survival and quality of life, and the possibility of a relapse or relapse.","<study> <population> patients with locally advanced NSCLC <sep>

373," Complex approaches show promise, with some persistence of abstinence (30 days point prevalence abstinence or continuous abstinence at six months), especially those incorporating elements sensitive to stage of change and using motivational enhancement and CBT. We await results of recent trials of Not on Tobacco trials and more data is needed on sustained quitting that allows for the episodic nature of much adolescent smoking. There were few trials with evidence about pharmacological interventions (nicotine replacement and bupropion), and none demonstrated effectiveness for adolescent smokers. There is not yet sufficient evidence to recommend widespread implementation of any one model. There continues to be a need for well-designed adequately powered randomized controlled trials of interventions for this population of smokers."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of any specific type of counselling for smoking cessation. Further research is needed to identify the most effective type and duration of counselling, and to compare the effectiveness and safety of counselling with other types of counselling. Finally, there is a need for further research into the effectiveness of psychological counselling for nicotine replacement therapy.","<study> <population> Consecutive sample (n = 191) of 13-17 year

374," The results suggest cell salvage is efficacious in reducing the need for allogeneic red cell transfusion in adult elective cardiac and orthopaedic surgery. The use of cell salvage did not appear to impact adversely on clinical outcomes. However, the methodological quality of trials was poor. As the trials were unblinded and lacked adequate concealment of treatment allocation, transfusion practices may have been influenced by knowledge of the patients' treatment status potentially biasing the results in favour of cell salvage."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of any of the interventions reviewed in this review. However, there is a need for further well-designed trials to evaluate the effectiveness of these interventions in terms of blood transfusion, blood loss, transfusion capacity, and transfusion efficiency.

375," There is significant evidence to suggest that topical application of chlorhexidine to umbilical cord reduces neonatal mortality and omphalitis in community and primary care settings in developing countries. It may increase cord separation time however, there is no evidence that it increases risk of subsequent morbidity or infection. There is insufficient evidence to support the application of an antiseptic to umbilical cord in hospital settings compared with dry cord care in developed countries."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of alcohol disinfection as an alternative to manual cord cleaning in the treatment of umbilical cord separation. Further research is needed to determine the best disinfection regimen, the best method of disinfection, and the most effective disinfection method. Further trials are also needed to assess the effectiveness of water disinfection in reducing cord separation time and to compare disinfection with manual cord cleansing.","<study> <population> 669 neonates were enrolled in the trial <sep> neonates with dry umbilical cord care <sep> All neonates of two neonatal care units were invited to take part in the study <sep> umbilical cord care of the newborn </population> </study> <study> <population> normal newborns <sep> 311 normal newborn infants </population> </study> <study> <population> One hundred and fifty neonates </population> </study> <study> <population> newborn infants were tested <sep> nursery </population> </study> <study> <population> Forty-eight <sep> 100 neonates born at the National Tokyo Medical Centre from March to May 2000 and nursed at a maternity ward were enrolled </population> </study> <study> <population> Dadu, a rural area of Sindh province, Pakistan <sep> 9741 newborn babies <sep> a rural district of Pakistan <sep> Liveborn infants delivered by participating TBAs who received birth kits were eligible for enrolment in the study <sep> 187 clusters </population> </study> <study> <population> 180 neonates </population> </study> <study> <population> umbilical cord care <sep> 634 infants were enrolled, with 599 infants (94%) completing the study <sep> infants admitted to the well-baby nursery </population> </study> <study> <population> Newborn infants delivered in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Faculty of Medicine Siriraj Hospital <sep> newborn infants <sep> Four hundred and twenty-seven infants were enrolled </population> </study> <study> <population> Eligible infants <34 weeks gestation admitted to the NICU <sep> A total of 109 infants were enrolled; 102 completed the study <sep> preterm infants </population> </study> <study> <population> newborn infant </population> </study> <study> <population> newborn cord care <sep> Tertiary-level university teaching hospital and level II community hospital <sep> 1,876 singleton full-term newborns enrolled, 1,811 completed the study </population> </study> <study> <population> Two hundred and seventy one infants </population> </study> <study> <population> 1,535 healthy term infants <sep> healthy term infants </population> </study> <study> <population> </population> </study> <study> <population> </population> </study> <study> <population> pre-term babies <sep> pre-term babies within the Neonatal Unit of Ninewells Hospital, Dundee </population> </study> <study> <population> 536 strains were isolated <sep> newborn infants <sep> A total of 410 infections were registered in 377 (15.4%) of the 2,441 infants </population> </study> <study> <population> healthy term neonates <sep> healthy newborns <sep> Of 148 participants, 136 (92%) completed the protocol </population> </study> <study> <population> 373 singleton near- to full-term newborns enrolled in the study, 312 completed the study <sep> newborn infants <sep> primary-level newborn nursery at a university teaching hospital and a private hospital </population> </study> <study> <population> All livebirths were eligible; those visited within 7 days by a local female village health worker trained to deliver the cord care intervention were enrolled <sep> Between June, 2007, and September, 2009, we enrolled 29 760 newborn babies (10 329, 9423, and 10 008 in the multiple-cleansing, single-cleansing, and dry cord care groups, respectively <sep> 0·80 <sep> 133 clusters <sep> rural Bangladesh </population> </study> <study> <population> 244 preterm newborns with a gestational age of <34 weeks and a birth weight of <2500 g.

376," We found insufficient evidence to determine if overground physical therapy gait training benefits gait function in patients with chronic stroke, though limited evidence suggests small benefits for uni-dimensional variables such as gait speed or 6MWT. These findings must be replicated by large, high quality studies using varied outcome measures."," Walking speed and gait speed are similar to those measured in the Functional Balance Scale, but the difference in fitness is smaller. Walking speed is associated with a decreased risk of falls and falls, but is not associated with an increase in risk of falling. Running speed appears to have a beneficial effect on fitness, but there is no evidence of an improvement in fitness. Running Speed appears to be faster than walking speed or gait velocity, but this is not clear from this review. Running time is slower than treadmill speed. Running speeds appear to be slower in the short-term, but not in the long-term. Run time is faster in the intermediate-term and longer-term than in the shorter-term but the longer term results are still not clear. Running times are slower than walking time, but more accurate. Running distances are slower, but slower. Running distance is slower, and slower in shorter intervals, but faster in longer intervals. Running lengths are slower and faster in shorter periods, but are not as fast as treadmill speed or treadmill speed, or faster in slower periods, or longer periods. Running intervals are slower in slower-term runners than treadmill speeds, but shorter in shorter term runners. Run-time is slower in older runners than in younger runners. Running tests are faster in older people, but longer term data are still lacking. Running machines appear to have fewer adverse effects in younger people than treadmill time. Running shoes appear to improve speed and fitness in slower runners, but further research is needed to determine whether this is true for younger people or older people. Run tests are more likely to have an adverse impact on fitness and fitness, and are less likely to be carried out in older patients. Running test results are less consistent in younger and older people than in older adults, but results are more consistent in older and younger people, and in younger adults.

377," CABG is associated with reduced rates of major adverse cardiac events, mostly driven by reduced repeat revascularisation.

378," Our review should provide some guidance to clinicians and patients. On the basis of high quality evidence, natalizumab and IFNß-1a (Rebif) are superior to all other treatments for preventing clinical relapses in RRMS in the short-term (24 months) compared to placebo. Moderate quality evidence supports a protective effect of natalizumab and IFNß-1a (Rebif) against disability progression in RRMS in the short-term compared to placebo. These treatments are associated with long-term serious adverse events and their benefit-risk balance might be unfavourable. IFNß-1b (Betaseron) and mitoxantrone probably decreased the odds of the participants with RRMS having relapses, compared with placebo (moderate quality of evidence). The benefit-risk balance with azathioprine is uncertain, however this agent might be effective in decreasing the odds of the participants with RRMS having relapses and disability progression over 24 to 36 months, compared with placebo. The lack of convincing efficacy data shows that IFNß-1a (Avonex), intravenous immunoglobulins, cyclophosphamide and long-term steroids have an unfavourable benefit-risk balance in RRMS. None of the included treatments are effective in decreasing disability progression in patients with progressive MS. It is important to consider that the clinical effects of all these treatments beyond two years are uncertain, a relevant point for a disease of 30 to 40 years duration. Direct head-to-head comparison(s) between natalizumab and IFNß-1a (Rebif) or between azathioprine and IFNß-1a (Rebif) should be top priority on the research agenda and follow-up of the trial cohorts should be mandatory."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of IL-2 inhibitors in the treatment of relapses in patients with relapses remitting or relapse-remitting MS.

382," Early intervention programmes for preterm infants have a positive influence on cognitive and motor outcomes during infancy, with the cognitive benefits persisting into pre-school age. There is a great deal of heterogeneity between studies due to the variety of early developmental intervention programmes trialled and gestational ages of the preterm infants included, which limits the comparisons of intervention programmes. Further research is needed to determine which early developmental interventions are the most effective at improving cognitive and motor outcomes, and on the longer-term effects of these programmes."," Cognitive enhancers are effective in enhancing cognitive performance and enhancing caregiver-related skills. Positive effects on caregiver performance were observed in the control group, but the results were not statistically significant in the comparison group. Positive results were found in the cognitive enhancers group, which were not significantly different from the control groups. Positive findings were found for cognitive enhancer therapy, which was associated with a significant improvement in cognitive performance. Cognitive enharmaceutical therapy is effective in improving cognitive enharmancy in the assessment of caregiver skills and enhancing social functioning. Positive conclusions were also found for psychological enharmour therapy, but these conclusions are based on a small number of studies with short-term follow-up and are not necessarily representative of the whole range of developmental enharmours evaluated in this review. Further research is needed to assess the effects of enharmOUR therapy on social functioning and developmental outcomes, as well as for developmental outcomes such as language development, social functioning, cognitive functioning, language comprehension and social functioning in the developmental group.","<study> <population> Neonates weighing less than 2,200 grams and under 37 weeks

385," The results of this review give some support to ciclesonide as an equivalent therapy to other ICS at similar nominal doses. The studies assessed low doses of steroids, in patients whose asthma required treatment with low doses of steroids. At half the dose of FP and BDP/BUD, the effects of ciclesonide were more inconsistent The effect on candidiasis may be of importance to people who find this to be problematic. The role of ciclesonide in the management of asthma requires further study, especially in paediatric patients. Further assessment against FP at a dose ratio of 1:2 is a priority."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of corticosteroids in the treatment of people with chronic lung disease. There is a need for further well-designed, well-conducted and reported randomized controlled trials to evaluate the efficacy and safety of these medications in the management of these patients. Finally, there is an urgent need for a standardised assessment of the effectiveness of corticoagulants in the control of chronic lung diseases, including those with asthma who do not have

387," No effect was shown for specific outcomes: laboratory-proven influenza, pneumonia and death from pneumonia. An effect was shown for the non-specific outcomes of ILI, GP consultations for ILI and all-cause mortality in individuals ≥ 60. These non-specific outcomes are difficult to interpret because ILI includes many pathogens, and winter influenza contributes < 10% to all-cause mortality in individuals ≥ 60. The key interest is preventing laboratory-proven influenza in individuals ≥ 60, pneumonia and deaths from pneumonia, and we cannot draw such conclusions. The identified studies are at high risk of bias. Some HCWs remain unvaccinated because they do not perceive risk, doubt vaccine efficacy and are concerned about side effects. This review did not find information on co-interventions with HCW vaccination: hand washing, face masks, early detection of laboratory-proven influenza, quarantine, avoiding admissions, anti-virals, and asking HCWs with ILI not to work. We conclude there is no evidence that vaccinating HCWs prevents influenza in elderly residents in LTCFs. High quality RCTs are required to avoid risks of bias in methodology and conduct, and to test these interventions in combination."," Influenza vaccination is effective in reducing mortality in healthcare staff and reducing hospitalizations in patients with ILI.

395," Based on two small trials, there was no significant difference in pain relief in women receiving oral analgesics compared with placebo or no treatment (129 women; MD -3.51; 95% CI -10.03 to 3.01). We consider this evidence to be of a low to moderate quality. In routine clinical practice, intracervical injection of local anaesthetic with a vasoconstrictor (lignocaine plus adrenaline or prilocaine plus felypressin) appears to be the optimum analgesia for treatment. However, further high-quality, adequately powered trials should be undertaken in order to provide the data necessary to estimate the efficacy of oral analgesics, the optimal route of administration and dose of local anaesthetics."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the effectiveness of acupuncture for pain relief in adults undergoing elective cervical surgery. Further research is needed to determine the effectiveness and safety of acupuncture, and to compare acupuncture with other analgesics, and also to assess the efficacy of acupuncture in children.

398," We do not know whether PQ added to treatment regimens for patients with P. falciparum infection reduces transmission of malaria. In individual patients, it reduces gametocyte prevalence and density. In practical terms, even if PQ results in large reductions in gametocytes in people being treated for malaria, there is no reliable evidence that this will reduce transmission in a malaria-endemic community, where many people are infected but have no symptoms and are unlikely to be treated. Since PQ is acting as a monotherapy against gametocytes, there is a risk of the parasite developing resistance to the drug. In terms of harms, there is insufficient evidence from trials to know whether the drug can be used safely in this way in populations where G6PD deficiency occurs. In light of these doubts about safety, and lack of evidence of any benefit in reducing transmission, countries should question whether to continue to use PQ routinely in primary treatment of malaria. Further synthesis of observational data on safety and new trials may help elucidate a role for PQ in malaria elimination, or in situations where most infected individuals are symptomatic and receive treatment."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of SP monotherapy for the treatment of P. falciparum.

Lower dose regimens also conferred benefits for cessation, while reducing the incidence of adverse events. More participants quit successfully with varenicline than with bupropion. Two open-label trials of varenicline versus NRT suggested a modest benefit of varenicline but confidence intervals did not rule out equivalence. Limited evidence suggests that varenicline may have a role to play in relapse prevention. The main adverse effect of varenicline is nausea, but mostly at mild to moderate levels and tending to subside over time. Possible links with serious adverse events, including serious psychiatric or cardiovascular events, cannot be ruled out. Future trials of cytisine may test extended regimens and more intensive behavioural support. There is a need for further trials of the efficacy of varenicline treatment extended beyond 12 weeks."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the effectiveness of nicotine replacement therapy for the treatment of nicotine dependence in people with a history of smoking cessation. Nicotine replacement therapy appears to be effective in reducing nicotine dependence, but its effectiveness is not clear in patients who are already taking it. The results of this review suggest that nicotine replacement may be a viable option for those smokers who are willing to take it. However, this conclusion is based on a small number of studies with a high risk of bias and a lack of reporting of adverse events.","<study> <population> smokers using varenicline <sep> 2010 American

405," There is not enough evidence to recommend any intervention for preventing excessive weight gain during pregnancy, due to the significant methodological limitations of included studies and the small observed effect sizes. More high-quality randomised controlled trials with adequate sample sizes are required to evaluate the effectiveness of potential interventions."," Dietary carbohydrate intake during pregnancy is associated with a reduction in maternal weight gain, a decrease in maternal hunger and a decrease of maternal hunger. However, there is no clear evidence of an effect on maternal hunger or maternal hunger on maternal wellbeing or maternal wellbeing. Dietary carbohydrate intakes are associated with an increased risk of developing hypoglycaemia, a decreased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and an increase in maternal thirst and thirst. Dietary carbohydrates are also associated with decreased maternal hunger, but there is insufficient evidence to recommend dietary carbohydrate intake as a substitute for dietary fibre intake. Dietary fiber intake should be considered as an adjunct to dietary fiber intake in the treatment of pre-partum weight gain.","<study> <population> 70 women who met the inclusion criteria, 62 completed the study (32 in the LGI and 30 in the HGI groups <sep> healthy women </population> </study> <study> <population> both pregnant and non-pregnant women </population> </study> <study> <population> a 3900-bed medical centre in northern Taiwan with around 3000 births annually <sep> Taiwanese childbearing women <sep> 189 women who had regular check-ups during pregnancy and gave birth at the medical centre <sep> Taiwanese women </population> </study> <study> <population> overweight and obese women <sep> Pregnant women were approached at their first antenatal visit, and body mass index (BMI) was calculated to determine whether they were overweight or obese (BMI > 25 <sep> Australian and New Zealand Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology <sep> Eligible women <sep> obese pregnant women <sep> 2011 </population> </study> <study> <population> Eighty sedentary women <sep> healthy women during their entire pregnancy on their perception of health status </population> </study> <study> <population> Nulliparous women <sep> 100 women were randomized to the study (lifestyle counseling 57, routine prenatal care 43 </population> </study> <study> <population> normal-weight women (BMI (body mass index) of 19.8-26.0) gain 25-35 lb (11.4-15.9 kg) during pregnancy, and that overweight women (BMI of 26.1-29.0) gain 15-25 lbs (6.8-11.4 kg <sep> normal weight women <sep> Women (n=120) who had a BMI>19.8, age>18 and <20 weeks gestation were recruited from a hospital-based clinic serving low-income women and randomized by race and BMI category to the intervention or control group <sep> women who gain more than the IOM recommendation <sep> pregnant women </population> </study> <study> <population> Seventy-five women who exercised regularly were evaluated before pregnancy </population> </study> <study> <population> NW women and prevented postpartum weight retention in NW and OW/OB women <sep> women who exceeded the 1990 Institute of Medicine (IOM) recommendations for gestational weight gains and increase the proportion of women who returned to pregravid weights by 6 mo postpartum <sep> Participants were pregnant (13.5 wk gestation), normal-weight (NW; n = 201) and overweight or obese (OW/OB; n = 200) women whose average age was 28.8 y.
