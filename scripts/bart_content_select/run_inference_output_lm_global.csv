0," There is inadequate evidence to draw strong conclusions on the efficacy or safety of the drug interventions included in this review. There is some low quality evidence from a meta-analysis of two studies investigating urokinase (various strengths) and some very low evidence from two single studies investigating alteplase 2 mg/2 mL that suggest that these two drug interventions may be effective in treating withdrawal or total occlusion of CVC lumens caused by thrombosis. Further high quality, sufficiently powered research is still required to look at the efficacy and safety of urokinase, alteplase and other chemical, surgical and drug interventions for treating CVC lumen occlusion. Research studies which exclusively include child participants are especially warranted."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of antifibrinolytic agents in the treatment of CVAD. Further research is needed to determine the effectiveness and safety of these agents, and to compare them to each other in terms of catheter function. Further trials are also needed to assess the effectiveness of these drugs in reducing CVAD function and the risk of infection, as well as the risks of infection and infection, and also to compare these drugs with each other. Finally, future trials are needed to evaluate the efficacy and safety and effectiveness of antimicrobials in improving CVAD functions."
1," Collaborative care is associated with significant improvement in depression and anxiety outcomes compared with usual care, and represents a useful addition to clinical pathways for adult patients with depression and anxiety."," There is insufficient evidence to draw conclusions about the effectiveness of cognitive behavioral therapy for depression in the primary care setting. Further research is needed to determine the effectiveness and safety of cognitive behavioural therapy in depression, and to compare cognitive behavioral therapies to other types of psychological therapy. Finally, there is a need for further research into the efficacy of cognitive behaviour therapy in depressive disorders, as well as to compare the effects of cognitive behavior therapy to other forms of mental health care, including psychological therapies, and other psychological therapies."
2, Administration of systemic prophylactic antibiotics for PEG tube placement reduces peristomal infection.," Antibiotic prophylaxis is effective in reducing the incidence of peristomal infections and reducing the risk of death and infection in patients with PEG. Antibiotics do not appear to have a significant effect on mortality or infection-related morbidity in patients undergoing PEG insertion. However, there is a need for further research into the effectiveness of antibiotics in treating PEG infections and the risks of bacterial contamination in the early post-transplant period."
3," The limited available evidence suggests folate may have a potential role as a supplement to other treatment for depression. It is currently unclear if this is the case both for people with normal folate levels, and for those with folate deficiency."," Cognitive memory training appears to be a useful adjunct to cognitive memory training in the treatment of depressive symptoms. However, it is not clear whether it is a worthwhile adjunct to other cognitive rehabilitation programmes. Further research is needed to assess the effects of cognitive memorytraining on depressive symptoms in people with depression and cognitive impairment, as well as on cognitive function and memory training, and to compare cognitive memory rehabilitation with other psychological therapies, including cognitive behavioural rehabilitation programmes, and cognitive behavioural therapy. Finally, there is a need for a well-designed, well-conducted and reported randomised controlled trial to evaluate the effectiveness of cognitive-memory training for depression, cognitive impairment and memory rehabilitation."
4," Intensive interventions, unsuited to primary care or population prevention programmes, provide only minimal reductions in blood pressure during long-term trials. Further evaluations to assess effects on morbidity and mortality outcomes are needed for populations as a whole and for patients with elevated blood pressure. A low sodium diet may help in maintenance of lower blood pressure following withdrawal of antihypertensives. If this is confirmed, with no increase in cardiovascular events, then targeting of comprehensive dietary and behavioural programmes in patients with elevated blood pressure requiring drug treatment would be justified."," Sodium restriction is associated with a reduction in blood pressure and blood pressure in patients with hypertension. However, there is no evidence of a significant difference in mortality, cardiovascular morbidity or morbidity between sodium restriction and sodium restriction, or between sodium and potassium restriction. Sodium restriction does not appear to have a significant impact on blood pressure or blood pressure, but may have a beneficial effect on cardiovascular risk factors, such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes mellitus, and on mortality and morbidity."
5," We found no reason to change current treatment recommendations. However, considerable uncertainty continues to exist about the optimal schedule for desferrioxamine in people with transfusion-dependent thalassaemia."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of deferoxamine for the treatment of iron overload in patients with iron overload. Further research is needed to identify the optimal dose, duration and timing, and the best way to deliver deferoxamines to iron overload patients, and to evaluate the effects on other iron overload conditions. Finally, to determine the optimal dosage, timing and duration, the best dose and duration of deferoxideamine for iron overload and iron overload is needed. The results of this review should be interpreted with caution, as the conclusions of the review were based on a small number of patients, with a high risk of bias."
6," The pregnancy rate was found to be higher when GnRHa was used in a long protocol as compared to a short or ultrashort protocol. There was no evidence of a difference in live birth rate, but this outcome was only reported by three studies. There was no evidence of a difference in the outcomes amongst various long protocols; nor that stopping or reducing GnRHa at the start of stimulation was associated with a reduced pregnancy rate. For all comparison, except a long versus short protocol, there was a lack of power."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of progestogen as a supplement to LHH in IVF cycles. Further randomized controlled trials are needed to determine whether progestogens are beneficial or harmful for LHH or LHH, and to assess the effects on pregnancy rate and reproduction rates in LHH and LHH cycles. Finally, long-term data are required to evaluate the effects of gonadotrophins on pregnancy rates and fertility rates in RHH cycles, and also to assess LHH as a complement to LHRH."
7," The available evidence indicates some beneficial effects with second-generation antipsychotics, mood stabilisers, and dietary supplementation by omega-3 fatty acids. However, these are mostly based on single study effect estimates. Antidepressants are not widely supported for BPD treatment, but may be helpful in the presence of comorbid conditions. Total BPD severity was not significantly influenced by any drug. No promising results are available for the core BPD symptoms of chronic feelings of emptiness, identity disturbance and abandonment. Conclusions have to be drawn carefully in the light of several limitations of the RCT evidence that constrain applicability to everyday clinical settings (among others, patients' characteristics and duration of interventions and observation periods)."," Weight loss is associated with a significant increase in weight gain. Weight loss appears to be associated with an increase in depressive symptoms, but there is no clear evidence of an effect on weight loss in the short-term or longer term. Weight gain appears to have a beneficial effect on depressive symptoms and on self-reported depressive symptoms. However, weight loss is not a significant issue for people with borderline personality disorder, and there is a need for further well-designed studies to evaluate the effects of weight loss on depressive disorders."
8," In patients with stable COPD, pMDI produced similar outcomes to a dry powder device for delivering beta2-agonists, but the very small number of studies and included patients does not permit firm conclusions to be drawn. The soft mist device for ipratropium was more effective than a pMDI, but the data come from one small study. There need to be further well designed randomised controlled trials to define the role of inhaler devices using bronchodilators in stable COPD."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of bronchodilator in the treatment of PIE. Further research is needed to determine the effectiveness and safety of this therapy in PIE, and to compare the efficacy and safety profile of these drugs in terms of their efficacy and effectiveness in the clinical context of the PIE treatment group. Finally, there is a need for a meta-analysis of the effectiveness of Bronchoder for PIE and its safety profile, as well as to compare these drugs to each other."
9," For most ""red flags,"" there is insufficient evidence to provide recommendations regarding their diagnostic accuracy or usefulness for detecting spinal malignancy. The available evidence indicates that in patients with LBP, an indication of spinal malignancy should not be based on the results of one single ""red flag"" question. Further research to evaluate the performance of different combinations of tests is recommended."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of bone scintigraphy for the treatment of LBP. There is a need for further research in this area, particularly in the areas of osteoporosis, bone mineralization and bone mineralisation, as well as in areas of bone mineral density and thickness, and in areas with a history of erosion and erosion. The results of these studies should be interpreted with caution, as they are based on only a small number of patients and are subject to a high risk of bias. Further research is needed to assess the effectiveness of bone scaffolding for LBP, and to compare the effectiveness and durability of these scaffolding devices."
10," Evidence from two RCTs suggests no significant benefits or harms of peritoneal drainage over laparotomy. However, due to the very small sample size, clinically significant differences may have easily been missed. No firm recommendations can be made for clinicians. Large multicentre randomised controlled trials are needed to address this question definitively."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the existence of a continuum of survivorship after laparotomy. Further randomized controlled trials are needed to determine the effectiveness of continuum resuscitation, the duration of survival, and the extent to which it is possible to achieve this. Such trials are also needed to evaluate the effectiveness and durability of continuum survival. Such tests are also required to assess the durability of the continuum ofSurvival. They are also necessary to determine whether continuum resuscitative techniques are more or less effective than continuous resuscitation techniques, or if they are less effective."
11," There is some evidence that a vein cuff at the distal anastomosis site improves primary graft patency rates for below knee PTFE graft, but this does not reduce the risk of limb loss. Evidence for this beneficial effect of vein cuffed PTFE grafts is weak and based on an underpowered trial. Pre-cuffed PTFE grafts have comparable patency and limb salvage rates to vein cuff PTFE grafts. The use of spliced veins improved secondary patency but this did not translate into improved limb salvage. The use of an AVF alone showed no added benefits. A large study with a specific focus on below knee vein cuff prosthetic grafts, including PTFE, is required."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the existence of a difference in patency and limb salvage rates between the two methods of bypass grafting. Further research is needed to determine the optimal technique and timing of this procedure, and to compare the effectiveness of different techniques of grafting and platelet transfusion, and also to compare different types of grafts and types of platelet infusion. Finally, to assess the effectiveness and safety of different methods of graft clamping, a meta-analysis is required to determine whether there are any differences in mortality, patency or patency between these methods."
12," Limited evidence suggests that the method of antibiotic administration (oral versus parenteral) does not affect the rate of disease remission if the bacteria are sensitive to the antibiotic used. However, this and the lack of statistically significant differences in adverse effects need confirmation. No or insufficient evidence exists for other aspects of antibiotic therapy for chronic osteomyelitis."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of nifedipine as a monotherapy in Klebsiella pneumonia, or to support its use as an adjuvant to other monotherapy. Further randomized controlled trials are needed to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of this monotherapy, and to assess the effectiveness of other monotherapies, such as oral antibiotics, as well as to compare the efficacy and effectiveness of these monotherapsies with each other."
13, It is not possible to conclude about the use of any kind of pharmacologic therapies for maintenance treatment of opium dependence.," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the effectiveness of psychosocial interventions for retention of opioid withdrawal symptoms. Further research is needed to determine the effectiveness and safety of these interventions, and to assess the efficacy and effectiveness of these approaches in the treatment of withdrawal symptoms, and also to evaluate the efficacy of psychoses for retention in treatment. Recommendations for future research should be made regarding the efficacy, safety and efficacy of psychological therapies for withdrawal symptoms of opioids withdrawal symptoms and for the management of retention in therapy."
14," There is weak evidence that the interventions FR-4 with lip-seal training and palatal crib associated with high-pull chincup are able to correct anterior open bite. Given that the trials included have potential bias, these results must be viewed with caution. Recommendations for clinical practice cannot be made based only on the results of these trials. More randomised controlled trials are needed to elucidate the interventions for treating anterior open bite."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the existence of a negative feedback loop in the downward direction of growth. Further research is needed to determine whether or not this feedback loop has a negative effect on growth or injury rates, and whether it has a positive effect on health or wellbeing, or on health-related quality of life, and on productivity, productivity, and quality-of-life. Future research should focus on measuring the effects of feedback loop feedback on health and wellbeing, as well as on productivity and wellbeing. Research is also needed to assess the effects on health, wellbeing and social functioning."
15," Acupuncture appeared to be safe but without clear evidence of benefit. The number of patients is too small to be certain whether acupuncture is effective for treatment of acute ischaemic or haemorrhagic stroke. Larger, methodologically-sound trials are required."," Functional assessment is a useful tool for improving functional outcome and quality of life in stroke patients. However, the quality of the evidence is low and there is a need for further well-designed studies to evaluate the effectiveness of functional assessment and social support services for stroke patients and their caregivers, and to compare functional assessment with other types of assessment and assessment. Future research should focus on assessing the effectiveness and reliability of functional assessments and assessing functional assessment, and also on assessing functional outcome measures, such as mobility function, balance, quality of LIFE, and health-related quality of Life."
16," More women experienced pain relief, and fewer had additional pain relief, with paracetamol compared with placebo, although potential adverse effects were not assessed and generally the quality of studies was unclear."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of any specific analgesic for pain relief in adults with severe acute pain. Further research is needed to assess the effectiveness of various analgesics, including oxytocin, ibuprofen, naproxen and ibuprotrophin, as well as the effects of other analgesics on pain relief and quality of life. Finally, there is a need for a meta-analysis of pain relief for adults with mild to moderate acute pain, and to compare pain relief with other analgesic options."
17," This update has provided additional confirmation on the effectiveness of antidepressants for neuropathic pain and has provided new information on another antidepressant - venlafaxine. There is still limited evidence for the role of SSRIs. Whether antidepressants prevent the development of neuropathic pain (pre-emptive use) is still unclear. Both TCAs and venlafaxine have NNTs of approximately three. This means that for approximately every three patients with neuropathic pain who are treated with either of these antidepressants, one will get at least moderate pain relief. There is evidence to suggest that other antidepressants may be effective but numbers of participants are insufficient to calculate robust NNTs. SSRIs are generally better tolerated by patients and more high quality studies are required."," There is insufficient evidence to recommend amitriptyline monotherapy for the treatment of pain in neuropathic pain or fibromyalgia, or to recommend its use as an adjunct to other antidepressants in the management of pain relief in neuropathy. The results of this review are based on a small number of small studies, all of which were of poor quality, and are subject to a high risk of bias. There is a need for further well-designed studies with larger sample sizes and longer follow-up periods to evaluate the effectiveness of amitoshimonoside monotherapy."
18," No results are conclusive and all are based on small, short, studies. It would be understandable, however, if clinicians were cautious in prescribing doses in excess of 7.5 mg/day of haloperidol to a person with uncomplicated acute schizophrenia, and if people with schizophrenia were equally reticent to take greater doses. Further research is needed regarding the efficacy and tolerability of the >1.5-3.0 mg/day dose range."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of haloperidol as an adjunct to other antipsychotic drugs in the treatment of episodic psychotic disorders, or to support its use as an alternative to standard antipsychotics in treating episodic psychosis. Further research is needed to identify the optimal dose and duration of halperidol, the optimal dosage and timing, and the best way to administer it. Finally, future trials should evaluate the efficacy and safety of other drugs such as ibuprofen, naproxen, risperidone, ibuprophylaxis, and ibupropubic acid, as well as the effectiveness of these drugs in reducing episodic depressive disorder."
19," Oseltamivir and zanamivir appear to have modest benefit in reducing duration of illness in children with influenza. However, our analysis was limited by small sample sizes and an inability to pool data from different studies. In addition, the inclusion of data from published trials only may have resulted in significant publication bias. Based on published trial data, oseltamivir reduces the incidence of acute otitis media in children aged one to five years but is associated with a significantly increased risk of vomiting. One study demonstrated that laninamivir octanoate was more effective than oseltamivir in shortening duration of illness in children with oseltamivir-resistant influenza A/H1N1. The benefit of oseltamivir and zanamivir in preventing the transmission of influenza in households is modest and based on weak evidence. However, the clinical efficacy of neuraminidase inhibitors in 'at risk' children is still uncertain. Larger high-quality trials are needed with sufficient power to determine the efficacy of neuraminidase inhibitors in preventing serious complications of influenza (such as pneumonia or hospital admission), particularly in 'at risk' groups."," There is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of ipratropium for the treatment of people with influenza A, nor to recommend its use as an adjunct to other antiviral drugs. There is a need for further well-designed randomized controlled trials with larger sample sizes and longer follow-up periods to evaluate the efficacy and safety of IPN for influenza A and influenza A in adults and children, and to compare the effectiveness and safety and effectiveness of IPNs for these conditions. These trials should be of sufficient size to compare IPNs with placebo or no treatment."
20," Despite reviewing 39 eligible trials, few firm conclusions could be reached because of the multiple comparisons considered, the small size of individual trials, and their low quality. Whether or not to use a particular policy is usually a trade-off between the risks of morbidity (especially infection) and risks of recatheterisation."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of retrograde urethral catheters for postoperative urinary retention. Further research is needed to determine the optimal catheter type and timing of catheter removal, and to compare the effectiveness of retrograding urethrography with retrograde Urethral Catheters in terms of bladder emptying rates. Finally, future research should focus on determining the timing and duration of catheter removal, as well as the optimal timing and frequency of recatheterisation."
21," We did not find good evidence to show that HBOT improves clinical outcomes when applied during the acute presentation of ischaemic stroke. While evidence from the six RCTs is insufficient to provide clear guidelines for practice, the possibility of clinical benefit has not been excluded. Further research is required to better define the role of HBOT in this condition."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of HBOT in the treatment of people with acute ischaemic stroke. Further randomized controlled trials are needed to evaluate HBOT for acute stroke, and to compare HBOT with HBOT, HBOT alone or in combination, or to assess its effect on mortality, cardiovascular morbidity, and disability in patients with an acute stroke. Such trials are also needed to assess HBOT as a standalone treatment option, as well as to assess the effects of HBOTS on mortality and disability."
22, The use of prophylactic steroids in pediatric patients to reduce postoperative complications commonly experienced following cardiopulmonary bypass surgery is not supported by the existing evidence. Further well designed and adequately powered randomized controlled trials are needed to more accurately estimate the benefit and harm of this intervention.," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of eosinophils for IL-6 and IL-7. However, there is a need for further well-designed studies to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of these agents in the management of IL-8 and IL–7. Such studies should include a number of parameters, including the duration of the intervention, the number of patients transferred to ICU, and duration of recovery. They should also evaluate the effect of easinophilic agents on IL-10 and IPD, and on the incidence of adverse events."
23, We could not find convincing evidence to support or refute endoscopic biliary stenting on the mortality in patients with pancreatico-biliary malignancy. Large randomised trials are needed to settle the question of pre-surgical biliary stenting.," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of serum albumin for the treatment of biliary obstruction. Further randomized controlled trials are needed to determine the effectiveness and safety of albumin in this setting. Such trials are also needed to evaluate the effects of serum albumsin on liver function and liver function in patients with biliary obstructions, and to compare the effectiveness of serumalbumin with placebo or no treatment. Finally, there is a need for a meta-analysis of the efficacy and safety profile of serum Albumin for biliary drainage."
24," T-tube drainage appeared to result in significantly longer operating time and hospital stay compared with primary closure without any apparent evidence of benefit on clinically important outcomes after open common bile duct exploration. Based on the currently available evidence, there is no justification for the routine use of T-tube drainage after open common bile duct exploration in patients with common bile duct stones. T-tube drainage should not be used outside well designed randomised clinical trials. More randomised trials comparing the effects of T-tube drainage versus primary closure after open common bile duct exploration may be needed. Such trials should be conducted with low risk of bias and assessing the long-term beneficial and harmful effects of T-tube drainage, including long-term complications such as bile stricture and recurrence of common bile duct stones."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of bile acids for the treatment of postoperative bacteremia. Further research is needed to identify the best bile acid solution and the best way to achieve this. Finally, there is a need for a meta-analysis of the effects of bure acids on mortality, morbidity and morbidity in patients undergoing bureascial surgery, and to evaluate the effectiveness of other methods of biliary drainage in the management of these conditions."
25, The effects of surgical treatment in the management of the shoulder in people with rheumatoid arthritis are largely unknown due to the paucity of randomised controlled trials.," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the existence of a mechanism of relaxation of the humeral fascia. Further research is needed to establish the effectiveness of relaxation techniques in the management of humeral folds and fascia, and to compare relaxation techniques with relaxation techniques. Finally, there is a need for further research into relaxation techniques, strengthening exercises and relaxation techniques for relaxation of muscles and joints, and strengthening exercises for relaxation and flexibility in the hamular fascia in the hands and feet."
26, The overall analysis shows a benefit in pulmonary outcomes in the group electively ventilated with HFJV. Of concern is the significant increase in acute brain injury in one trial which used lower mean airway pressures when ventilating with HFJV. There are as yet no long term pulmonary or neurodevelopmental outcomes from any of the trials.," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of EPO in the treatment of BPD. Further research is needed to identify the optimal EPO dose and duration, and to compare EPO with standard oxygen therapy. It is also important to note that EPO does not appear to be associated with a reduction in the incidence of PEEP, or a decrease in the risk of death, or an increase in the occurrence of pneumonia, or both."
27," Community-based interventions and antenatal contraceptive counselling improved uptake of copper IUD contraception. Since the copper IUD is one of the most effective reversible contraceptive methods, primary care and family planning and practitioners could consider adopting these interventions. Although our review suggests these interventions are clinically effective, a cost-benefit analysis may be required to evaluate applicability."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the effectiveness of intrauterine devices for the prevention of unintended pregnancies. Further research is needed to establish the effectiveness and reliability of intra-uterine device contraception and to assess the effectiveness, reliability and durability of these interventions. Finally, there is a need for a well-designed, conducted and reported randomised controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy and reliability, and to compare intra-peritoneal contraceptive methods and timing."
28," Radiofrequency thermal ablation seems a potentially promising technique for the treatment of small hepatocellular carcinoma. However, more randomised clinical trials are needed."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the existence of a difference in survival rates between the two methods of survival. Further randomized controlled trials are needed to determine the effectiveness and safety of these methods. Such trials are also needed to evaluate the effectiveness of these techniques in the absence of a differential survival rate. They are also required to assess the effects of various types of radiation therapy, such as ultraviolet radiation therapy and infrared radiation therapy. They should also evaluate the effects on survival and quality of life, as well as the impact on quality and quantity of life. Finally, they should evaluate the impact of the various methods of radiotherapy on survival, and on the quality of the life of survivors."
29, Disconnect systems should be the preferred exchange systems in CAPD.," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of antibiotics in the treatment of peritonitis. Further randomized controlled trials are needed to determine the effectiveness of antibiotic therapy in reducing the incidence and severity of infections, and to compare antibiotic therapy with other methods of antibiotic treatment. Such trials should be of high methodological quality, with a focus on identifying patients who will benefit from antibiotic therapy, and comparing antibiotic therapy to antibiotic therapy. They should also compare antibiotic treatment with antibiotic therapy and antibiotic therapy as well as to antibiotic treatment as a comparison with antibiotic treatment in terms of infection rates."
30," Medication treatments can be effective in paediatric anxiety disorders, acting to reduce core symptoms, and should be considered as part of the treatment of these disorders. The greatest number of trials showing efficacy to date have assessed the SSRIs in treating paediatric OCD. There is no clear evidence to show that any particular class of medication is more effective or better tolerated than any other. As quantitative data was only available for the SSRIs and venlafaxine the routine use of benzodiazepines cannot be recommended, especially given concerns of dependency and treatment -related emergent adverse events associated with this class of drugs. Future RCTs could help identify potential clinical moderators of treatment efficacy. Studies of the long-term efficacy of medication treatment, optimal dosage, as well as direct comparisons of pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy are also warranted."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the effectiveness of psychotherapy for anxiety disorders in children and adolescents with anxiety disorders. Further research is needed to determine the effectiveness, safety and efficacy, and to compare psychotherapy with other psychotherapy options, including antidepressants, antidepressants, and antidepressants, as well as to determine whether psychotherapy is more effective or less effective than placebo. Finally, future research should evaluate the efficacy and safety of psychological therapies in children with anxiety disorder, and also assess the effectiveness and effectiveness of antidepressant therapy."
31," Long-acting beta-2 agonists, particularly salmeterol, are more effective than theophylline in improving morning and evening PEF, but are not significantly different in their effect on FEV1. There is evidence of decreased daytime and nighttime short-acting beta-2 agonist requirement with salmeterol. Fewer adverse events occurred in participants using long-acting beta-2 agonists (salmeterol and formoterol) as compared to theophylline."," Theophylline has a beneficial effect on sleep quality in the short-term and on sleep quantity in the long-term. However, there is a need for further well-designed studies to evaluate the effects of this drug on sleepiness, sleep quantity and quality of life in patients with chronic asthma. Such studies should be of sufficient size to detect clinically important differences in sleep quality and sleep quantity between the various classes of drugs. They should also evaluate the effect of the drug on symptoms of sleepiness and sleepiness in the longer term."
32," Chemotherapy is effective in prolonging time to disease progression and survival in patients with advanced colorectal cancer. The survival benefit may be underestimated by this meta-analysis, as a proportion of patients in the control arms of some trials received chemotherapy. No age related differences were found in the effectiveness of chemotherapy, but elderly patients were under represented in trials. Treatment toxicity and impact upon quality of life and symptom control have been inadequately assessed in the majority of trials and further research is needed to clarify the palliative benefit of chemotherapy."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the existence of any difference in survival benefit between prophylactic and adjuvant chemoprophylactic chemotherapy in patients with metastatic Toxicity. Further randomized controlled trials are needed to determine the optimal dose, duration and timing of chemotherapy and to compare the effects of these treatments on survival and quality of life. Such trials are also needed to evaluate the effectiveness of chemotherapy in the treatment of Toxicity, and to assess the impact of chemotherapy on quality and quantity of life in patients who are deemed to be at high risk of developing Toxicity or progression-free survival."
33," PGS as currently performed significantly decreases live birth rates in women of advanced maternal age and those with repeated IVF failure. Trials in which PGS was offered to women with a good prognosis suggested similar outcomes. PGS technique development is still ongoing in an effort to increase its efficacy. This involves biopsy at other stages of development (polar body or trophectoderm biopsy) and other methods of analysis (comparative genome hybridisation (CGH) or array-based technologies) than used by the trials included in this review. These new developments should be properly evaluated before their routine clinical application. Until such trials have been performed, PGS should not be offered as routine patient care in any form."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the existence of a correlation between embryo transfer rates and live birth rate. Further research is needed to identify the best way to integrate embryo transfer into the management of live birth rates and to compare embryo transfer with other methods of embryo retrieval. Finally, there is a need for further research into the effects of embryo transfer on maternal and neonatal outcomes, and to assess the impact on maternal or neonatal wellbeing and on maternal outcomes."
34," The analysis of the five included trials comparing intravenous versus oral steroid therapy for MS relapses do not demonstrate any significant differences in clinical (benefits and adverse events), radiological or pharmacological outcomes. Based on the evidence, oral steroid therapy may be a practical and effective alternative to intravenous steroid therapy in the treatment of MS relapses."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of oral corticosteroids for the treatment of Gd-enhancing lesions in adults with MS. Further randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm the effectiveness of corticostosteroids in this population, and to compare the effectiveness and safety of these drugs in the management of GD-enhanced lesions with placebo. Such trials are also needed to determine the effectiveness, safety and efficacy of these medications in the maintenance treatment of MS."
35," This systematic review suggests that the use of external stents following pancreaticoduodenectomy may be beneficial. However, only a limited number of RCTs with rather small sample sizes were available. Further RCTs on the use of stents after pancreaticoduodenectomy are warranted."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the existence of a protective mechanism for pancreatic fistula. Further randomized controlled trials are needed to determine the effectiveness and safety of this intervention. Such trials are also needed to evaluate the effectiveness of other interventions, such as intra-arterial drainage drainage drainage, intra-vaginal drainage drainage and intravenous hydration drainage drainage. These trials should be of sufficient size to assess the effectiveness, safety and effectiveness of various interventions, as well as to compare these interventions to each other and to compare them with each other."
36, New studies should focus on patient-oriented outcomes to clarify the benefit-risk ratio of rosiglitazone therapy. Safety data and adverse events of all investigations (published and unpublished) should be made available to the public.," There is no evidence to support or refute the use of glucagon as an adjunct to insulin therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. However, glucagon appears to have a beneficial effect on glycaemic control in the short-term. Its use is associated with a reduction in LDL-cholesterol and a decrease in triglyceride levels. It is not clear whether glucagon has an effect on blood pressure or blood sugar levels, but glucagon should be considered for those patients who do not respond to glucagon therapy or insulin therapy."
37," Pedestrian safety education can result in improvement in children's knowledge and can change observed road crossing behaviour, but whether this reduces the risk of pedestrian motor vehicle collision and injury occurrence is unknown. There is evidence that changes in safety knowledge and observed behaviour decline with time, suggesting that safety education must be repeated at regular intervals."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the effectiveness of safety training in the management of accidents. Further research is needed to identify the most effective safety training exercises and the best way to improve safety training. It is also important to understand the mechanisms by which safety training works, and to compare safety training with other training programmes. Future research should focus on measuring safety training effectiveness and reliability, as well as assessing the effects of training on accidents and injury rates."
38," The outcomes reported severely limit conclusions for clinical practice. We found little robust evidence that sterile water is effective for low back or any other labour pain. Neither did we find any difference in delivery or other maternal or fetal outcomes. Further large, methodologically rigorous studies are required to determine the efficacy of sterile water to relieve pain in labour."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the effectiveness of epidural analgesia for pain relief in low-back pain. Further research is needed to determine the effectiveness and safety of epidurals in low back pain. Finally, there is a need for a well-designed, well-conducted and executed randomised controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy and effectiveness of opioid analgesia in this condition. Finally there is an urgent need for an assessment of the effectiveness, safety and effectiveness, and to compare the effectiveness to other analgesia."
39," There is no reliable evidence from the trials reviewed concerning the effect of spinal as compared to general anaesthesia on the incidence of post-operative apnoea, bradycardia, or oxygen desaturation in ex-preterm infants undergoing herniorrhaphy. The estimates of effect in this review are based on a total population of only 108 patients or fewer. A large well designed randomised controlled trial is needed to determine if spinal anaesthesia reduces post-operative apnoea in ex-preterm infants not pretreated with sedatives. Adequate blinding, follow up and intention to treat analysis are required."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of echocardiography for apnea. Further randomized controlled trials are needed to evaluate the effectiveness of eichocardiographic techniques in apnea and bradycardia, and to determine the effectiveness and safety of these techniques in the management of apnea in the long term. Such trials are also needed to assess the efficacy of the various methods of electrocholinergics in apneas, as well as to assess their effectiveness in the longer term."
40," Aroma therapy showed benefit for people with dementia in the only trial that contributed data to this review, but it is important to note there were several methodological difficulties with this study. More well designed large-scale RCTs are needed before clear conclusions can be drawn on the effectiveness of aroma therapy. Additionally, several issues need to be addressed, such as whether different aroma therapy interventions are comparable and the possibility that outcomes may vary for different types of dementia."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the existence of a subgroup of people with dementia who are at high risk of developing dementia. Further research is needed to establish the effectiveness of subgroup therapy in dementia, as well as what types of people are most likely to benefit from it. It is also important to understand the nature of dementia and the mechanisms by which it relates to dementia and dementia, and to identify the type of dementia that may be most useful in dementia."
41," Simple advice has a small effect on cessation rates. Assuming an unassisted quit rate of 2 to 3%, a brief advice intervention can increase quitting by a further 1 to 3%. Additional components appear to have only a small effect, though there is a small additional benefit of more intensive interventions compared to very brief interventions."," There is insufficient evidence to draw conclusions about the effectiveness of psychosocial interventions for quitting smoking. Recommendations for future research include: (1) the use of nicotine gum, (2) the introduction of nicotine replacement therapy, and (3) the initiation of a nicotine replacement drug (NRT). (4) The introduction of an electronic nicotine replacement product, (5) the application of a benzodiazepine or nicotine gum tablet, and(6) the insertion of an NRT device. (7) The application of an antidepressant or nicotine replacement medication to a patient or caregiver, (8) the addition of an e-cigarette to an antidepressant; (9) the provision of an oral nicotine replacement device, (10) a nicotine substitution machine, and an electronic questionnaire (10). The application process of these interventions is more intensive than that of a written questionnaire."
42," We found no evidence to support antioxidant supplements for primary or secondary prevention. Beta-carotene and vitamin E seem to increase mortality, and so may higher doses of vitamin A. Antioxidant supplements need to be considered as medicinal products and should undergo sufficient evaluation before marketing."," Vitamin E supplementation is associated with a reduction in the incidence of all-cause mortality and cardiovascular disease. Vitamin E supplements are associated with an increase in the number of cases of adverse events, including cardiac arrest, and a decrease in the risk of stroke, but no significant difference in total deaths or hospitalizations. Vitamin A supplements do not appear to have a significant impact on mortality or cardiovascular disease, but may have a beneficial effect on the incidence and severity of these adverse events. Vitamins E and zinc supplementing supplements may reduce mortality and morbidity, but further research is needed to confirm this."
43," Methylphenidate, clonidine, guanfacine, desipramine and atomoxetine appear to reduce ADHD symptoms in children with tics. Although stimulants have not been shown to worsen tics in most people with tic disorders, they may nonetheless exacerbate tics in individual cases. In these instances, treatment with alpha agonists or atomoxetine may be an alternative. Although there is evidence that desipramine is effective for both tics and ADHD in children, safety concerns will likely continue to limit its use in this population."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the effectiveness of psychotherapy for ticlopidine in the treatment of ADHD. Further research is needed to determine whether psychotherapy is beneficial or harmful, and what dose, duration and intensity of therapy is most effective in reducing the severity of the symptoms of ADHD and its tic-related symptoms. Finally, there is a need for further research into the efficacy and effectiveness of psychological therapies for ADHD, as well as to compare psychotherapy with other treatments."
44," Parenteral high dose methotrexate and sulfasalazine are the only two agents with well demonstrated published efficacy in psoriatic arthritis. The magnitude of the effect seen with azathioprine, etretinate, oral low dose methotrexate and perhaps colchicine suggests that they may be effective but that further multicentre clinical trials are required to establish their efficacy. Furthermore, the magnitude of the improvement observed in the placebo group strongly suggests that uncontrolled trials should not be used to guide management decisions in this condition."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of creatine for the treatment of psoriasis or psoriatic arthritis. Further research is needed to determine whether creatine has a beneficial effect on quality of life, pain and function in patients with these conditions, and to compare creatine with placebo or no treatment, and whether creatine is more effective than placebo or placebo in reducing pain and stiffness in patients who are unable to tolerate creatine or its analogues. Finally, long-term data are needed to evaluate the effects of creatine on pain, stiffness and function."
45," There is no significant difference between once weekly versus thrice weekly subcutaneous administration of rHuEPO. Once weekly administration would require an additional 12 U/kg/wk for patients on haemodialysis, however this is based on one very small study. Cost of additional rHuEPO needs to assessed with regard to patient preference and compliance."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of iron supplements in the treatment of iron deficiency anaemia. Further research is needed to determine whether iron supplements are beneficial or harmful for this condition, and whether iron supplementation is beneficial in the management of this condition. Further trials are also needed to assess the effects of iron supplementation on iron deficient anaemia, and to compare iron supplementation with other iron supplements. Finally, long-term data are needed to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of iron supplementing iron supplements for iron deficiencies in anaemia patients."
46," The pooled evidence derived from trials of gabapentin suggests that it is not efficacious for the prophylaxis of episodic migraine in adults. Since adverse events were common among the gabapentin-treated patients, it is advocated that gabapentin should not be used in routine clinical practice. Gabapentin enacarbil is not efficacious for the prophylaxis of episodic migraine in adults. There is no published evidence from controlled trials of pregabalin for the prophylaxis of episodic migraine in adults."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of ibuprofen for the treatment of acute migraine, or to support its use as an adjunct to other anti-migraine drugs, or as an adjuvant to other treatments. Further research is needed to identify the optimal dose, duration and duration, and the best dose to use, and to assess the efficacy and safety of these drugs in acute migraine. Recommendations for future research should be made in light of the increasing prevalence of migraine, the increasing frequency of adverse events and the increasing number of patients suffering from adverse events."
47," This review provides evidence that PRT is an effective intervention for improving physical functioning in older people, including improving strength and the performance of some simple and complex activities. However, some caution is needed with transferring these exercises for use with clinical populations because adverse events are not adequately reported."," The results of this review support the use of aerobic exercise as an adjunct to conventional physical activity. However, the results are based on a small number of small studies, all of which were conducted in the 1990s and 2000s, and the results of these studies are still the same. Further research is needed to determine whether aerobic exercise is more effective than manual exercise as a supplement to physical activity or as a substitute for aerobic exercise in terms of bone mineral density and muscle strength, and to compare aerobic exercise with manual exercise."
48," For the considered outcomes, it seems that adding any psychosocial support to standard maintenance treatments do not add additional benefits. Data do not show differences also for contingency approaches, contrary to all expectations. Duration of the studies was too short to analyse relevant outcomes such as mortality. It should be noted that the control intervention used in the studies included in the review on maintenance treatments, is a program that routinely offers counselling sessions in addition to methadone; thus the review, actually, did not evaluate the question of whether any ancillary psychosocial intervention is needed when methadone maintenance is provided, but the narrower question of whether a specific more structured intervention provides any additional benefit to a standard psychosocial support. These interventions probably can be measured and evaluated by employing diverse criteria for evaluating treatment outcomes, aimed to rigorously assess changes in emotional, interpersonal, vocational and physical health areas of life functioning."," Counselling attendance appears to have a positive effect on retention of abstinence. However, it is not clear whether it has an effect on relapse or relapse rates, or on relapse rates or relapse rate, or whether counselling attendance has a negative impact on relapse rate and relapse rates. The results of this review suggest that counselling attendance may have an important impact on retention in abstinence, but that it is unlikely that it will have a significant impact on quality of life and relapse rate. Further research is needed to assess the effects of counselling attendance on relapse, relapse rates and relapse severity."
49," There is insufficient evidence to recommend steroids for symptom control in infectious mononucleosis. There is a lack of research on the side effects, including potential adverse effects or long-term complications."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of antibiotics in the treatment of EBV. Further research is needed to determine the effectiveness of antibiotic therapy in EBV, and to compare antibiotic therapy with other treatments, such as antibiotics for EBV-related symptoms, or to compare the effectiveness and effectiveness of antibiotics with other anti-EBV treatments. Further trials are needed to assess the efficacy of antibiotics, the effectiveness, and the impact of antibiotics on EBV symptoms, as well as to compare antibiotics with each other."
50," Aldosterone antagonists contribute to reduction of proteinuria in patients with CKD who are already on ACEi and ARB but increase the risk of hyperkalaemia. Available studies are small and have short follow-up. Long-term effects on renal outcomes, mortality and safety are unknown."," There is no evidence to support or refute the use of antihypertensive drugs for the treatment of albuminuria in humans with CKD. However, there is a need for further well-designed and executed randomised controlled trials to evaluate the effects of these drugs on renal function, kidney function and quality of life in people with DKD. Such trials should be of high quality, with a focus on improving quality and quantity of data. They should also evaluate the effect of the treatment on kidney function."
51," Family intervention may reduce the number of relapse events and hospitalisations and would therefore be of interest to people with schizophrenia, clinicians and policy makers. However, the treatment effects of these trials may be overestimated due to the poor methodological quality. Further data from trials that describe the methods of randomisation, test the blindness of the study evaluators, and implement the CONSORT guidelines would enable greater confidence in these findings."," Family counselling is effective in reducing relapse rates in people with schizophrenia and family distress. Family counselling may reduce relapse rates, but it is not clear whether it has an impact on quality of life. Family counseling is effective as an adjunct to other psychotherapeutic approaches, but is associated with a higher rate of psychological distress and a decreased rate of depression. Family therapy may be effective as a component of a broader range of psychotherapies, but its effectiveness is unclear. Family counsellors may have a role to play in the management of relapse, but the quality of the evidence is low and the number of studies is low. Further research is needed to assess the effectiveness of family counselling as a part of a multifaceted approach."
52," Prenatal TRH, in addition to corticosteroids, given to women at risk of very preterm birth do not improve infant outcomes and can cause maternal side-effects."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of prophylactic corticosteroids in the treatment of NICU neonates. Further research is needed to determine the optimal dose, duration and timing of treatment and to assess the effects on NICU mortality and morbidity in neonates who are at risk of death from NICU discharge. Finally, there is a need for further research into the effectiveness and safety of these agents in neonatal resuscitation."
53," The currently available evidence suggests a PFS benefit for patients with relapsed or refractory HL after first-line therapy, who are treated with HDCT followed by ASCT compared to patients treated with conventional chemotherapy. In addition, data showes a positive trend regarding OS, but more trials are needed to detect a significant effect. Intensifying the HDCT regime before HDCT followed by ASCT did not show a difference as compared to HDCT followed by ASCT, but was associated with increased adverse events."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of prophylactic antibiotics in the treatment of ORT. Further research is needed to determine the best antibiotic for ORT, and to compare the effectiveness of these agents in terms of survival and quality of life in patients with ORT who are at high risk of relapse or relapse. It is also important to note that there is a need for further research in this area, as well as to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity profiles of these drugs in particular."
54," The studies in this review are limited by sample size which are often divided into multiple comparison groups. Most comparisons showed no significant differences, with wide confidence intervals. Although extra-amniotic prostaglandins may be as effective as other modalities in initiating labour, there is little conclusive information from this review to guide clinical practice. An adequately powered randomised controlled trial would be useful to determine if the use of extra-amniotic prostaglandins would lower the rate of caesarean section."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of oxytocin as an induction agent for caesarean section. Further research is needed to determine the best induction agent and the safest induction method. Finally, there is a need for a meta-analysis of the effectiveness and safety profiles of various induction methods, and to compare the effectiveness of these methods to other induction methods. Finally there is an urgent need for an assessment of the efficacy and safety profile of induction methods and the risks associated with them. This should be done in accordance with the recommendations of the Cochrane Handbook of Obstetrics and Gynecology."
55," Diflunisal has an analgesic effect similar to other NSAIDs in single dose, but benefits from providing significant analgesia for about twelve hours. This property may be useful when regular dosing is needed, or when taking several doses of a shorter acting analgesic is impractical."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of ibuprofen as an adjunct to standard analgesia in the treatment of acute pain. Further research is needed to determine the optimal dose and duration of ibiprofen, the optimal duration of analgesia, and the optimal dosage and timing of administration in acute pain, and to assess the effectiveness and safety of other analgesia types. Finally, future research should evaluate the effectiveness of other NSAIDs in pain relief, as well as the efficacy and safety profiles of these drugs."
56, This review of randomised controlled trials showed that vigabatrin can reduce seizure frequency in people with drug-resistant partial epilepsy. Short-term follow-up of patients showed that some side effects were associated with its use. Further analysis of longer-term observational studies is required to evaluate how likely patients are to develop visual field defects and whether such side effects are associated with dose and duration of drug use.," Vigilant vigabatrin is effective in reducing the number of seizures and the frequency of adverse events. Its efficacy appears to be similar to that of gabapentin, but with a higher incidence of adverse effects. Its effectiveness is similar to its effectiveness in the control of seizures with GVG, but it is not clear whether it is more effective than GVG in reducing seizures with or without GVG. It is unclear whether it has an effect on other adverse events, such as nausea or vomiting, or on quality of life, but its efficacy appears similar to GVG with respect to frequency and severity of adverse event profiles. Vigilant gabavatrin appears to have a similar efficacy to GGV, but has a higher risk of having an adverse event profile. Its use is associated with an increased risk of narcolepsy, and a decreased risk of seizures in the long term. Its adverse effects are similar to those of GVG but its use is not associated with a reduction in seizures in GVG or GVG alone. Its duration is longer than that of other GVG agonist drugs. It appears that Vigilant GGB is more likely to have an adverse effect on GVG and GVG compared to GGB, but the exact duration of the treatment is unclear. Vigilante GGB has a longer duration and is less likely to cause adverse events in the short term. It has a shorter duration and has a lower risk of relapse, but a higher rate of relapse in the longer term, but is not significantly different from that of GGB with GGB. Its long-term efficacy is unknown, and its duration is unclear due to the rarity of the adverse events reported in this review. Vigilantes GGB appear to have similar efficacy as GGB and GGB in terms of seizure frequency, but have a longer course of action."
57," In adolescents and adults with sub-optimal control on low dose ICS monotherapy, the combination of LABA and ICS is modestly more effective in reducing the risk of exacerbations requiring oral corticosteroids than a higher dose of ICS. Combination therapy also led to modestly greater improvement in lung function, symptoms and use of rescue ß2 agonists and to fewer withdrawals due to poor asthma control than with a higher dose of inhaled corticosteroids. Apart from an increased rate of tremor and less oral candidiasis with combination therapy, the two options appear relatively safe in adults although adverse effects associated with long-term ICS treatment were seldom monitored. In children, combination therapy did not lead to a significant reduction, but rather a trend towards an increased risk, of oral steroid-treated exacerbations and hospital admissions. These trends raised concern about the safety of combination therapy in view of modest improvement in children under the age of 12 years."," There is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of salbutamol as a substitute for salbutafil in the treatment of patients with asthma who are unable to tolerate or tolerate salbutaminophen. Further randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm the effectiveness of salutamol in reducing the number of exacerbations and the severity of adverse events, as well as to compare salutaminophen with salutamide. Finally, long-term data are needed in order to determine the effectiveness and safety of saluting salutamyol as an alternative to salbutamide as a monotherapy for patients who are able to tolerate Salutamide as monotherapy."
58, There is currently no evidence of the effects of extraction of primary canine teeth in 10-13 year old children with one or two palatally displaced permanent canine teeth.," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of hydrocolloid gel gel as a substitute for saline gel in the treatment of successful eruption of an erupting volcano. Further research is needed to determine the optimal formulation and timing of hydocolloid fluid gel gel gel and to assess its effectiveness in the management of successful eruptions. It is also important to understand the mechanisms by which Hydrocolloids gel gel works, and to compare the effects of various types of gel gel in different settings."
59," The available data do not provide evidence of any beneficial effect of transpyloric feeding for preterm infants. Some evidence of harm exists, including a higher risk of gastrointestinal disturbance and mortality, but these findings should be interpreted and applied cautiously because of methodological weaknesses in the included trials."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of dietary fibre supplements for weight loss in NJ. Further randomized controlled trials are needed to determine whether fibre supplements are beneficial or harmful for weight gain in NJ, and to compare the effects of fibre supplements on mortality and morbidity. Further research is also needed to assess the effect of fibre supplementation on mortality, morbidity and mortality in NJ and to determine the effects on morbidity or mortality. Finally, long-term data are required to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of fibre supplementing diets in NJ as well as to compare fibre supplements with fibre supplements."
60," A significant health disparity exists, whereby Indigenous populations, a minority, are over-represented in the burden of smoking-related morbidity and mortality. This review highlights the paucity of evidence available to evaluate the effectiveness of smoking cessation interventions, despite the known success of these interventions in non-Indigenous populations. Due to this lack of published investigations, the external validity of this review is limited, as is the ability to draw reliable conclusions from the results. The limited but available evidence reported does indicate that smoking cessation interventions specifically targeted at Indigenous populations can produce smoking abstinence. However this evidence base is not strong with a small number of methodologically sound trials investigating these interventions. More rigorous trials are now required to assist in bridging the gap between tobacco related health disparities in Indigenous and non-Indigenous populations."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the effectiveness of nicotine replacement therapy for quitting tobacco use. Further research is needed to establish the effectiveness and safety of this therapy. It is also important to understand the mechanisms by which nicotine replacement has been used to improve quitting behaviour, as well as how nicotine replacement is used in the context of a reduction in smoking frequency and duration of abstinence. Finally, there is a need for further research into the efficacy and effectiveness of other nicotine replacement therapies, such as oral methadone and nicotine replacement."
61," The limited evidence suggests that home management is cost effective and preferred by patients. Further large trials comparing these treatments are unlikely to occur. Therefore, home treatment is likely to become the norm; further research will be directed to resolving practical issues."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of thrombolytic agents in the treatment of recurrent DVT. Further randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm the effectiveness of throbolytics in reducing the incidence of DVT recurrence and mortality, and to compare the effectiveness and safety of these agents with placebo or no treatment, and also to evaluate the effectiveness, safety and effectiveness of these drugs in reducing total mortality and morbidity in patients with DVT, including in those with a history of major bleeding."
62, Internal fixation is associated with less initial operative trauma but has an increased risk of re-operation on the hip. Definite conclusions cannot be made for differences in pain and residual disability between the two groups. Future studies should concentrate on better reporting of final outcome measures and function. There is still a need for studies to define which patient groups are better served by the different treatment methods.," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the existence of any difference in mortality rates between orthopaedic and robotic hip replacements. Further research is needed to determine the best way to minimise the risk of bias in this review and to assess the effectiveness of robotic hip replacement as a replacement for traditional hip replacement. Finally, there is a need for a well-designed, well-conducted and executed randomised controlled trial to evaluate the effects of robotic replacement on mortality rates and to compare robotic replacement with robotic replacement."
63," The evidence from this review suggests that there are no clinically meaningful BP lowering differences between available ARBs. The BP lowering effect of ARBs is modest and similar to ACE inhibitors as a class; the magnitude of average trough BP lowering for ARBs at maximum recommended doses and above is -8/-5 mmHg. Furthermore, 60 to 70% of this trough BP lowering effect occurs with recommended starting doses. The review did not provide a good estimate of the incidence of harms associated with ARBs because of the short duration of the trials and the lack of reporting of adverse effects in many of the trials."," There is no evidence to support or refute the use of hydrocortisone in reducing blood pressure in patients with hypertension. However, the amount of blood pressure reduction achieved was not significantly different from that achieved in the control group. There is a need for further well-designed, well-conducted and reported randomised controlled trials to determine the optimal dose and duration of hydocortisones in hypertension patients. Such trials should be undertaken in areas with high blood pressure, such as in areas where blood pressure is low."
64," There was evidence individual TFCBT, EMDR, stress management and group TFCBT are effective in the treatment of PTSD. Other non-trauma focused psychological treatments did not reduce PTSD symptoms as significantly. There was some evidence that individual TFCBT and EMDR are superior to stress management in the treatment of PTSD at between 2 and 5 months following treatment, and also that TFCBT, EMDR and stress management were more effective than other therapies. There was insufficient evidence to determine whether psychological treatment is harmful. There was some evidence of greater drop-out in active treatment groups. The considerable unexplained heterogeneity observed in these comparisons, and the potential impact of publication bias on these data, suggest the need for caution in interpreting the results of this review."," Psychotherapy appears to be a useful tool in the treatment of PTSD and its aftermath. However, there is insufficient evidence to recommend its use as an adjunct to other psychotherapy. Further research is needed to assess the effectiveness of psychotherapy for PTSD, and to compare psychotherapy with other psychological therapies, as well as to assess its effectiveness in other conditions, such as sleep deprivation, depression, insomnia, fatigue, sleep deprivation and sleep deprivation. Finally, future research should evaluate the efficacy of psychological therapies for PTSD and other psychological disorders, and also examine the effects of psychological therapy on sleep deprivation in particular, and on depression and anxiety."
65," Methenamine hippurate may be effective for preventing UTI in patients without renal tract abnormalities, particularly when used for short-term prophylaxis. It does not appear to work in patients with neuropathic bladder or in patients who have renal tract abnormalities. The rate of adverse events was low, but poorly described. There is a need for further large well-conducted RCTs to clarify this question, particularly for longer term use for people without neuropathic bladder."," There is insufficient evidence to recommend prophylactic antibiotic use in UTI. Further research is needed to determine the effectiveness of antibiotic use for UTI and to compare the effectiveness and safety of antibiotic administration in the treatment of UTI in women with a history of bacteriuria. Finally, there is a need for further research into the efficacy of antibiotics in UTIs in women who are undergoing antibiotic treatment for pyelonephritis, and for those who are unable to tolerate antibiotic treatment."
66," The available evidence is limited and the internal validity of these trials is questionable. Given the high losses to follow up, these reports may even be considered observational. Given that caveat, the biphasic pill containing norethindrone was associated with inferior cycle control compared with the triphasic pill containing levonorgestrel. The choice of progestin may be more important than the phasic regimen in determining bleeding patterns."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of oxytocin for the treatment of menstrual bleeding. Further research is needed to determine the effectiveness and safety of this drug for menstrual bleeding and to compare its effectiveness to other drugs, such as oxytocins, and to assess its effectiveness in the treatment treatment of other menstrual bleeding conditions. Finally, there is a need for a meta-analysis of the effectiveness, safety, and effectiveness of other drugs for menstrual blood loss and fertility."
67, We found no evidence to support or refute antioxidant supplements in patients with liver disease. Antioxidant supplements may increase liver enzyme activity.," Vitamin E supplementation is associated with a reduction in mortality and disability in patients with hepatitis C virus infection. Vitamin E supplements are associated with an increase in mortality, disability, liver function, and disability, but there is no evidence of an improvement in quality of life or health-related quality or quantity of life in patients treated with vitamin E supplements. Treatment with Vitamin E has a beneficial effect on liver function and liver function in patients who are not receiving vitamin E supplementation, but this is not clear from this review. The number of patients in the study was too small to draw conclusions."
68," On the basis of the evidence available in this review, no specific conclusion can be made regarding the superiority of one catheter class over another. Further adequately powered studies reporting on clinical outcomes (e.g. live birth rate) are required. Additional outcomes such as miscarriage rates and measures of discomfort need to be reported."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of hydrocortisone in the management of breast milk loss. Further research is needed to identify the best hydrocORTisone solution, the safest solution, and the best way to administer it. Finally, there is a need for a well-designed and executed randomised controlled trial to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of this solution. Such a trial is also needed to determine the best solution. It is also important to note that the data in this review are based on only a small number of cases, and therefore the conclusions of this review should be interpreted with caution."
69," Based on evidence from only one high-bias risk trial, it appears that early laparoscopic cholecystectomy (less than 24 hours after diagnosis of biliary colic) decreases the morbidity during the waiting period for elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy (mean waiting time 4.2 months), the hospital stay, and operating time. Further randomised clinical trials are necessary to confirm or refute these findings, and to determine if early laparoscopic cholecystectomy is better than the delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy if the waiting time is shortened further."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of digital scales for measuring health expenditure in health care settings. There is a need for well-designed and executed randomised controlled trials to evaluate the effects on health expenditure and quality of life. Such trials should be conducted in health settings with low risk of bias and with a focus on measuring health expenditures in health services settings. They should also assess health expenditure, quality-of-life and cost-effectiveness, and compare digital scales with digital scales."
70," Continuous monitoring of physiological variables for the first two to three days may improve outcomes and prevent complications. Attention to the changes in physiological variables is a key feature of a stroke unit, and can most likely be aided by continuous monitoring without complications related to immobility or to treatments triggered by the relief of abnormal physiological variables. Well-designed, high-quality studies are needed because many questions remain open and deserve further research. These include when to start continuous monitoring, when to interrupt it, which people should be given priority, and which treatments are most appropriate after the identification of abnormalities in physiological variables."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of electrostimulation as an adjunct to standard ICU care in the treatment of acute stroke. Further research is needed to establish the effectiveness of Electrostimulation in acute stroke, and to assess its effects on other outcomes, including quality of life and cost. It is also important to note that the results of this review are based on a small number of patients, all of whom were discharged from ICU earlier than expected, and that there is a need for further research."
71," Despite methodological limitations of the evaluation studies reviewed, the consistency of reported reductions in fall-related injuries across all programmes support the preliminary claim that the population-based approach to the prevention of fall-related injury is effective and can form the basis of public health practice. Randomised, multiple community trials of population-based interventions are indicated to increase the level of evidence in support of the population-based approach. Research is also required to elucidate the barriers and facilitators in population-based interventions that influence the extent to which population programmes are effective."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the existence of a correlation between involuntary falls and mortality. Further research is needed to establish the effectiveness of involuntary falls as a measure of mortality and morbidity, and to assess the effects on bodily function, balance, gait, reflexivity, and function of involuntary falling. Finally, future research should focus on assessing the effects of involuntary fall on bodily functions, balance and function, as well as on quality of life and injury rates, and on the impact on physical function."
72," Intracervical prostaglandins are effective compared to placebo, but appear inferior when compared to intravaginal prostaglandins."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of oxytocin gel as a substitute for vaginal gel in terms of cervical ripening time, cervical thickness, perinatal outcome, and cervical thickness. There is a need for further research into the effectiveness and safety of this treatment. In addition, there is an urgent need for an assessment of the effectiveness of uterotonics as an adjunct to vaginal gel administration in the treatment of vaginal fibroids, as well as a review of the efficacy and safety profiles of oxycodone gel."
73," No male hormonal contraceptive is ready for clinical use. Most trials were small exploratory studies. Their power to detect important differences was limited and their results imprecise. In addition, assessment of azoospermia can vary by sensitivity of the method used. Future trials need more attention to the methodological requirements for RCTs. More trials with adequate power would also be helpful."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of male hormones in the management of spermatogenesis. Men using male hormones should be encouraged to take part in this review. Men should be advised that male hormones do not appear to have a significant impact on sperm production. Men taking male hormones are unlikely to have an adverse effect on their sperm production, but men taking female hormones may have an increased risk of developing prostate cancer. Men who take male hormones will have a decreased risk of prostate cancer, but the number of men who develop prostate cancer will be reduced by male hormones. Women should be informed of the risks and benefits of male hormonal supplements and the possibility that male hormone supplements may have a negative effect on the sperm production of sperm producing men, but this is unlikely to be a significant issue."
74," Drug treatment with piracetam may be effective in the treatment of aphasia after stroke. Further research is needed to explore the effects of drugs for aphasia, in particular piracetam. The safety of the drug should be of primary interest. Researchers should examine the long-term effects and whether it is more effective than speech and language therapy."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the effectiveness of manual labour as an integral part of the management of human resource problems. Further research is needed to identify the best manual labour technique and the best way to integrate manual labour into management of resource problems in human resource management problems. It is also important to understand the mechanisms by which manual labour works, and how it relates to human resource utilisation, and to compare manual labour with other forms of labour management."
75, From the available evidence we cannot determine whether or not preoperative analgesics are of benefit in paediatric dentistry for procedures under local anaesthetic. There is probably a benefit in prescribing preoperative analgesics prior to orthodontic separator placement.," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of any specific analgesic for the treatment of post-extraction pain in people with orthodontic pain. There is a need for well-designed, conducted and reported randomised controlled trials to evaluate the effectiveness of various analgesics for post-operative pain relief in adults and children. Such trials are needed to determine the optimal analgesic regime and the optimal dosage and duration of analgesia, and to compare different analgesic regimens."
76," In contrast to the previous version of this review, our results suggest that therapeutic ultrasound may be beneficial for patients with osteoarthritis of the knee. Because of the low quality of the evidence, we are uncertain about the magnitude of the effects on pain relief and function, however. Therapeutic ultrasound is widely used for its potential benefits on both knee pain and function, which may be clinically relevant. Appropriately designed trials of adequate power are therefore warranted."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of ergonomic tools in the treatment of Knee pain and disability. Further research is needed to determine the best ergonomic tool to implement ergonomic techniques in Knee Pain Pain and Disability, and to compare ergonomic technologies to ergonomic methods. Finally, there is a need for further research into ergonomic devices for KneePain and Disability. These findings should be interpreted with caution, as they are based on a small number of studies with a high risk of bias, and are subject to considerable variation in outcome measures."
77," Depot perphenazine is in clinical use in the Nordic countries, Belgium, Portugal and the Netherlands. At a conservative estimate, a quarter of a million people suffer from schizophrenia in those countries and could be treated with depot perphenazine. The total number of participants in the four trials with useful data is 313. None of the studies observed the effects of oral versus depot antipsychotic drugs. Until well conducted and reported randomised trials are undertaken clinicians will be in doubt as to the effects of perphenazine depots and people with schizophrenia should exercise their own judgement or ask to be randomised."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of antidepressants in the treatment of AM. Further research is needed to identify the most effective antidepressant for AM. It is also important to understand the mechanisms by which antidepressants are used to treat AM, as well as the mechanism by which they are used in the management of AM, and to compare the effectiveness of antidepressants with placebo. Finally, there is a need for further research into the efficacy of antidepressants for AM, which is currently in its infancy."
78," This review was unable to demonstrate any advantage of CCPT over other airway clearance techniques in terms of respiratory function, but this may have reflected insufficient evidence rather than real equivalence between methods. There was a trend for participants to prefer self-administered airway clearance techniques. Limitations of this review included a paucity of well-designed, adequately-powered, long-term trials."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of intravenous antibiotics in the treatment of forced expiratory flow. Further research is needed to determine whether intravenous antibiotic therapy is more effective than oral antibiotic therapy in improving lung function and improving pulmonary function in patients admitted to intensive care, and to compare intravenous and oral antibiotics with oral antibiotics in terms of pulmonary function and lung function. Finally, there is a need for a well-designed, well-conducted and executed randomised controlled trial to evaluate the effects of intravenously antibiotic therapy on pulmonary function, and also to compare the effectiveness of antibiotic therapy to oral antibiotics."
79," No clear benefit was shown for open healing over surgical closure. A clear benefit was shown in favour of off-midline rather than midline wound closure. When closure of pilonidal sinuses is the desired surgical option, off-midline closure should be the standard management."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of any particular surgical technique for removing surgical sutures in patients with sinus infections. Further research is needed to identify the best surgical technique and the best way to minimise recurrence and minimise the risk of recurrence in these patients, and to evaluate the effectiveness of other surgical techniques, such as wound dressing, suturing devices, and wound dressing. Finally, future research is required to investigate the effectiveness and durability of various surgical techniques for treating sinus infection, and also to compare surgical techniques to other surgical methods."
80," There is insufficient evidence to know if the effects of unit-dose packaged antimalarial drugs reduce treatment failure. Unit-dose packaging, supported by prescriber training and patient information, appears to improve participant-reported treatment adherence, but these data come from trials with methodological limitations."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the effectiveness of any of the interventions reviewed in this review. There is a need for a large, well-designed and reported systematic review of the effectiveness and effectiveness of the various approaches to managing compliance. Such a review should be undertaken in the context of a large scale, multi-centre, multicentre, placebo-controlled, double-blind controlled trial with a focus on compliance with standard medication and adherence to standard medication."
81," In experienced hands, ultrasound provides at least as good success rates as other methods of peripheral nerve location. Individual studies have demonstrated that ultrasound may reduce complication rates and improve quality, performance time, and time to onset of blocks. Due to wide variations in study outcomes we chose not to combine the studies in our analysis."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of any specific type of anticholinergics in the treatment of sensory nerve block. Further research is needed to determine the optimal dose and duration of anticoagulation, the optimal timing and timing of analgesia, and the optimal dosage and timing for analgesia. Finally, future trials should evaluate the effectiveness and safety of various types of nerve stimulation, and also assess the effectiveness of different types of antiemetic agents, and their effectiveness in the management of pain, function and function."
82," Multiple interventions for upper limb sensory impairment after stroke are described but there is insufficient evidence to support or refute their effectiveness in improving sensory impairment, upper limb function, or participants' functional status and participation. There is a need for more well-designed, better reported studies of sensory rehabilitation."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the existence of a positive effect of relaxation exercises on hand function and independence in people with impaired limb function. Further research is needed to determine whether relaxation exercises are beneficial or harmful, and whether relaxing exercises may be beneficial or detrimental. Further studies are also needed to evaluate relaxation exercises for impaired limb functions and independence, and to compare relaxation exercises with relaxation exercises. Finally, studies are needed to assess relaxation exercises and relaxation exercises, as well as the effects of relaxation exercise on muscle strength and flexibility."
83," This review provided limited evidence that multi-media social marketing campaigns can promote HIV testing among MSM in developed countries. Future evaluations of social marketing interventions for MSM should employ more rigorous study designs. Long-term impact evaluations (changes in HIV or STI incidence over time) are also needed. Implementation research, including detailed process evaluation, is needed to identify elements of social marketing interventions that are most effective in reaching the target population and changing behaviours."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the effectiveness of digital media editing as a tool to improve journalistic integrity and journalistic integrity. Further research is needed to identify the most effective media editing techniques and to assess the effectiveness and reliability of such techniques. It is also important to understand the mechanisms by which media editing works, and how they are used in the context of a multifaceted media editing programme. Future research should focus on measuring journalistic integrity, transparency and accuracy, as well as on assessing the impact of media editing on journalistic integrity in journalism and journalism, and also on journalistic ethics."
84," Itraconazole modifies the immunologic activation associated with allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis and improves clinical outcome, at least over the period of 16 weeks. Adrenal suppression with inhaled corticosteroids and itraconazole is a potential concern."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of corticosteroids in the treatment of Aspergillus fumigatus. Further randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm the effectiveness of corticoagulation in the management of ASF. Such trials should be undertaken in the context of a large scale randomized controlled trial, preferably with a long-term duration of follow-up. They should include patients with a high risk of hypoglycaemia and a low risk of pneumothorax."
85," With an overall high grade of evidence this review revealed an improvement of clinical results (ACR50, 28 joint disease activity score (DAS-28) remission and HAQ scores) with certolizumab pegol. Adverse events were more frequent with certolizumab; there was a statistically significant increase in the number of serious adverse events, infections and hypertension."," There is no evidence to support or refute the use of progestogens in the treatment of PCOS. However, there is a need for further well-designed, conducted and reported randomized controlled trials to evaluate the efficacy and safety of these drugs in PCOS patients. Such trials should be of high methodological quality, with appropriate attention paid to outcome measures and duration of follow-up. They should also evaluate the effectiveness and safety, and the effectiveness of the progestogen as an adjuvant treatment for PCOS, as well as the quality of life of the patients treated."
86," Behavioural interventions for young women which aim to promote sexual behaviours protective of STI transmission can be effective, primarily at encouraging condom use. Future evaluations should include a greater focus on HPV and its link to cervical cancer, with long-term follow-up to assess impact on behaviour change, rates of HPV infection and progression to cervical cancer. Studies should use an RCT design where possible with integral process evaluation and cost-effectiveness analysis where appropriate. Given the predominance of USA studies in this systematic review evaluations conducted in other countries would be particularly useful."," Condoms are effective in reducing sexual risk behaviors and enhancing condom usage. Condoms appear to reduce sexual risk behaviours and enhance condom usage, but they do not appear to have a significant impact on sexual risk behaviour. The effectiveness of Condoms is unclear, and there is a need for further research into the effectiveness of condoms and condoms for sexual risk behavior and sexual risks behaviors in women and their partners, as well as in developing countries, where condoms are widely available. Condom training may improve condom usage and reduce sexual risks, but there is no evidence of a significant difference in sexual risks or STD rates between the two types of condoms or the same type of condoms. Condo training may also improve condom use, but it is not clear what type of training is most effective. Condos should not be used for sexual risks and sexual behaviors in the context of condom use and condom usage in developing nations."
87, There was no clear evidence of any effect of corticosteroids on substantive clinical outcomes. Those receiving steroids showed significantly greater improvement in platelet counts which was greater for those receiving dexamethasone than those receiving betamethasone. There is to date insufficient evidence of benefits in terms of substantive clinical outcomes to support the routine use of steroids for the management of HELLP. The use of corticosteroids may be justified in clinical situations in which increased rate of recovery in platelet count is considered clinically worthwhile.," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of beta-blockers in the treatment of HELLP syndrome. There is a need for further research in this area, particularly in the context of the introduction of antiplatelet agents, as well as in the development of a more efficient treatment strategy. In addition, there is an urgent need for a well-designed, well-conducted, transparent and reported randomised controlled trial to evaluate the effects of beta -blockers on mortality and morbidity in these patients."
88," To date there is no evidence of effective treatment in preventing malignant transformation of leukoplakia. Treatments may be effective in the resolution of lesion, however relapses and adverse effects are common."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of any of the treatments in the treatment of oral leukoplakia. There is a need for further research into the effectiveness of these treatments in terms of reducing the number and severity of lesions and improving the quality of life of patients with this condition. Finally, there is an urgent need for a well-designed and executed randomised controlled trial to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of the various treatments in this population."
89," The available RCT evidence suggests that repeated treatment of non-ischaemic MO secondary to BRVO with the anti-VEGF agent ranibizumab may improve clinical and visual outcomes at six and 12 months. However, the frequency of re-treatment has not yet been determined and the impact of prior or combined treatment with laser photocoagulation on the primary outcome is unclear. Results from ongoing studies should assess not only treatment efficacy but also, the number of injections needed for maintenance and long-term safety and the effect of any prior treatment."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of laser photocoagulation in the treatment of BCVA. Further research is needed to identify the best way to achieve this goal, and to compare laser photoagulation with other methods of optical manipulation. Finally, there is a need for a meta-analysis of the results of the two trials, which are currently in progress. The results of these trials should be interpreted with caution, as they are based on only a small number of patients and are subject to a high risk of bias, and therefore should be viewed with caution."
90," Two intervention types, the specialist epilepsy nurse and self-management education, have some evidence of benefit. However, we did not find clear evidence that other service models substantially improve outcomes for adults with epilepsy. It is also possible that benefits are situation specific and may not generalise to other settings. These studies included only a small number of service providers whose individual competence or expertise may have had a significant impact on outcomes. At present it is not possible to advocate any single model of service provision."," Cognitive behavioural therapy is effective in reducing the severity of depression and reducing the frequency of depressive symptoms. Positive effects of cognitive behavioural therapy are similar to those seen in other types of psychiatric therapy, but are associated with a higher incidence of depression. Cognitive behavioral therapy is less effective than behavioural therapy. Cognitive behavioural counselling is more effective than no treatment, but is associated with an increased risk of relapse. Cognitive behaviour therapy is more likely to result in an improvement in quality of life, but its effectiveness is not clear. Cognitive behavior therapy may be more effective in the treatment of depression or anxiety symptoms than behavioural counselling, but there is no clear evidence of an effect on severity or duration of depression in people with epilepsy. Positive findings of cognitive behaviour therapy are consistent with those of the previous review, but more research is needed to confirm these findings."
91," Most active recruitment strategies for breast cancer screening programs examined in this review were more effective than no intervention. Combinations of effective interventions can have an important effect. Some costly strategies, as a home visit and a letter of invitation to multiple screening examinations plus educational material, were not effective. Further reviews comparing the effective interventions and studies that include cost-effectiveness, women's satisfaction and equity issues are needed."," Screening mammography results in a significant reduction in the incidence of pap smears, but a significant increase in the risk of breast cancer. Screening results in an increase in breast cancer screening rates, but no significant difference in overall survival. Screenings are also associated with a significant decrease in the number of smear-related deaths, but this is based on a small number of studies with short-term follow-up and a very low risk of bias. Further research is needed to assess the effects of screening mammography on quality of life and health behaviours, as well as to compare screening mammograms with other screening methods."
92," The very limited evidence from the included studies suggests that SNS can improve continence in selected people with faecal incontinence, and reduce symptoms in selected people with constipation. However temporary, percutaneous stimulation for a two-to-three week period does not always successfully identify those for whom a permanent implant will be beneficial. Larger, good quality randomised crossover trials are needed to allow the effects of SNS for these conditions to be assessed with more certainty."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of relaxation exercises in the treatment of fecal incontinence. Further research is needed to determine whether relaxation exercises are beneficial or harmful for patients with Fecal Incontinence, and to assess relaxation exercises as an adjunct to relaxation exercises. Finally, there is a need for further research into relaxation exercises for patients who are struggling with relaxation. This is particularly important in areas where relaxation exercises do not seem to be beneficial or detrimental."
93," Antenatal digital perineal massage reduces the likelihood of perineal trauma (mainly episiotomies) and the reporting of ongoing perineal pain, and is generally well accepted by women. As such, women should be made aware of the likely benefit of perineal massage and provided with information on how to massage."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the effectiveness of acoustic stimulation in the treatment of sutured vulvar tears. Further research is needed to determine the effectiveness and safety of acoustic stimulating stimulation in this population, and to compare acoustic stimulation with other forms of stimulation, such as vibration stimulation, vibration stimulation and vibration stimulation. Finally, there is a need for further research into acoustic stimulation for sutures vulva tears, as well as to assess the effectiveness, safety and effectiveness of electromagnetic stimulation in these populations. Finally there is an urgent need for research into the effects of vibration stimulation on quality of life."
94," The studies included in this review do not allow firm conclusions as to the question of whether the quality of life of people after anterior resection is superior to that of people after abdominoperineal excision/Hartmann's operation. The included studies challenges the assumption that anterior resection patients fare better.Larger, better designed and executed prospective studies are needed to answer this question."," The results of this review support the use of relaxation exercises as a measure of quality of life. Relaxation exercises appear to have a beneficial effect on relaxation exercises, although results were not statistically significant in the short-term. Exercise exercises may have a positive effect on fatigue, but further research is needed to determine whether relaxation exercises are beneficial in the long-term or in the longer term. Further research is also needed to assess relaxation exercises and relaxation exercises for relaxation exercises after surgery."
95," In patients with acute gallstone pancreatitis, there is no evidence that early routine ERCP significantly affects mortality, and local or systemic complications of pancreatitis, regardless of predicted severity. Our results, however, provide support for current recommendations that early ERCP should be considered in patients with co-existing cholangitis or biliary obstruction."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the existence of a difference in mortality or morbidity in acute biliary pancreatitis. Further randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm whether there are differences in mortality and morbidity between the two approaches. Such trials are also needed to evaluate the effectiveness of the various methods of intra-oral drainage and the effects of these methods on morbidity and mortality, and to compare the effectiveness and safety of these approaches to other types of drainage."
96," We found conflicting evidence for erythropoiesis-stimulating agents to increase quality of life and hemoglobin level by treating anemia in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. However, this conclusion is based on randomized controlled trials with a high risk of bias, and relies on trials assessing human recombinant erythropoietin (EPO). The safety profile of EPO is unclear. Future trials assessing erythropoiesis-stimulating agents for anemia in rheumatoid arthritis should be conducted by independent researchers and reported according to the CONSORT statements. Trials should be based on Outcome Measures in Rheumatoid Arthritis Clinical Trials (OMERACT) and The Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) approaches for combining both clinician and patient perspectives."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of erythropoietin for the treatment of RA. Further randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm the effectiveness of arythropoiatin for RA. Such trials should include patients with a history of RA who are at high risk of relapse and those with severe anaemia. They should also evaluate the effects of other treatments, such as glucocorticoid therapy, as well as the effects on quality of life and health-related productivity."
97," The use of ergometrine-oxytocin as part of the routine active management of the third stage of labour appears to be associated with a small but statistically significant reduction in the risk of PPH when compared to oxytocin for blood loss of 500 ml or more. No statistically significant difference was observed between the groups for blood loss of 1000 ml or more. A statistically significant difference was observed in the presence of maternal side-effects, including elevation of diastolic blood pressure, vomiting and nausea, associated with ergometrine-oxytocin use compared to oxytocin use. Thus, the advantage of a reduction in the risk of PPH, between 500 and 1000 ml blood loss, needs to be weighed against the adverse side-effects associated with the use of ergometrine-oxytocin."," Manual removal of the placenta reduces the risk of postpartum haemorrhage and the need for blood transfusion, but there is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of this procedure as a substitute for manual removal. Further research is needed to determine the best method of manual removal and the best way to administer it. Finally, there is a need for an assessment of the risks and benefits of using manual removal as an alternative to manual removal, and to compare manual removal with manual removal of placentas."
98," The evidence from the limited number of studies suggests that psychological and educational interventions may result in increased abstinence from alcohol, and a reduction in alcohol consumption among pregnant women. However, results were not consistent, and the paucity of studies, the number of total participants, the high risk of bias of some of the studies, and the complexity of interventions limits our ability to determine the type of intervention which would be most effective in increasing abstinence from, or reducing the consumption of, alcohol among pregnant women."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the existence of a correlation between prenatal abstinence and maternal alcohol use. Further research is needed to establish the effectiveness of prenatal abstinence as a measure of maternal abstinence and to compare prenatal abstinence with prenatal abstinence, and to assess the effects of prenatal alcohol use on maternal alcohol intake. Finally, to assess its effect on maternal and neonatal mortality, a meta-analysis should be undertaken to determine its role in prenatal abstinence."
99," Treating simple corneal abrasions with a patch does not improve healing rates on the first day post-injury and does not reduce pain. In addition, use of patches results in a loss of binocular vision. Therefore it is recommended that patches should not be used for simple corneal abrasions. Further research should focus on large (greater than 10 mm2) abrasions."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the existence of a difference in healing rates between the two types of antiemetic drugs for corneal abrasions. Further research is needed to determine the effectiveness of these drugs in the treatment of these conditions and to compare them to each other in terms of healing rates, pain relief and satisfaction with treatment. Finally, there is a need for an assessment of the effects of these medications on quality of life and pain relief in the long term."
100," None of the three studies found that medication prior to transfusion reduces NHTR. This applied regardless of the patient's history of NHTR and the use of leukodepleted blood products in the transfusion. However, this conclusion is based on three trials of moderate to low quality. A better-powered RCT is necessary to evaluate the role of pretransfusion medication in the prevention of NHTR. Inclusion criteria should be restricted to patients at high risk of developing NHTR, with no restriction by age, history of transfusion reactions and type of blood products (leukodepleted or not)."," There is no evidence to support or refute the use of antiplatelet agents in the treatment of transfusion reactions. However, there is a need for further well-designed trials to evaluate the effectiveness of anti platelet agents on transfusion response and to compare the effectiveness and safety of these agents with placebo or no treatment. Such trials should be of high quality, preferably with low risk of bias, and should include patients with a history of allergic reactions. They should also include patients who are at high risk of infection, such as those who are allergic to platelet products, and those who do not have an allergy to these products."
101," There is a lack of evidence of effectiveness of the included interventions. Motivational interviewing and some family interventions may have some benefit. Cost-effectiveness has not yet been addressed in any studies, and further research is needed to determine whether any of these interventions can be recommended."," Parenting skills are effective in reducing sexual risk behaviours, reducing sexual initiation rates, reducing violence, and reducing violence. They are also effective in preventing sexual initiation and sexual initiation, reducing violent initiation rates and decreasing violence rates. Parenting Skills are effective as a tool to reduce sexual initiation rate, but they are also associated with a reduction in violence rates and violence rates, and a decreased risk of sexual initiation. Parents and their children are more likely to report positive results, but the quality of the evidence is low. Parents should be encouraged to take part in the evaluation of parent-child relationship skills as a core component of their parenting skills. Parents need to be aware of the risks and benefits of parenting skills as an integral part of the parenting skills programme, and of the role of parent training in reducing violence and violence. Parents also need to take into account the fact that parents and children are likely to respond negatively to parenting skills, and that they may have a role to play in helping parents to improve their own parenting skills and behaviours. Parents, children and parents need to weigh the potential benefits and drawbacks of parenting Skills as a standalone component of the programme, as well as the potential drawbacks and drawbacks. Parents can expect to be disappointed with the results of this review. Parents deserve to be informed of the potential pitfalls and pitfalls of coaching skills as part of their role in parenting skills programmes. Parents may also expect to find satisfaction with coaching skills, but this is unlikely to be sustained. Parents are also likely to have an easier time with parenting skills than their children, and will have a better understanding of the mechanisms by which parenting skills work. Parents have a greater chance of being disappointed with their child's behaviour, and may have more opportunities to seek support from parents and their carers. Parent training may also have an impact on behaviour change, but it is unclear whether this will translate into a greater proportion of successful parenting skills being employed as a part of a parenting programme. Parents' satisfaction with parenting"
102, There is evidence to favour SCS over standard conservative treatment alone to improve limb salvage and clinical situations in patients with NR-CCLI. The benefits of SCS must be considered against the possible harm of relatively mild complications and the costs.," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of SCS as a substitute for SCS in terms of limb survival, quality of life, pain relief, and function. Further research is needed to identify the optimal SCS dose and duration, and to compare SCS with SCS, SCS and SCS at different doses and times, and also to determine the optimal dosage and timing of scS. Finally, to determine whether SCS is better than SCS or SCS alone or in combination, to assess the effectiveness and safety of both methods. Finally to compare the efficacy and safety and effectiveness of these methods, to compare them to SCS using SCS."
103, The use of conventional systemic corticosteroids in patients with clinically quiescent Crohn's disease does not appear to reduce the risk of relapse over a 24 month period of follow-up. An updated literature search performed in July 2008 did not identify any new trials.," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of hydrocolloid tablets in the treatment of Crohn's disease. Further randomized controlled trials are needed to determine the efficacy and safety of hydocolloid cream in Crohn’s disease. Such trials should be undertaken in the context of a large scale randomized controlled trial, preferably with a long-term duration of follow-up, and with a focus on efficacy and tolerability. They should also evaluate the effects of hydropolloid therapy on relapse and relapse severity, as well as on quality of life."
104," Mass mailing a printed bulletin which summarises systematic review evidence may improve evidence-based practice when there is a single clear message, if the change is relatively simple to accomplish, and there is a growing awareness by users of the evidence that a change in practice is required. If the intention is to develop awareness and knowledge of systematic review evidence, and the skills for implementing this evidence, a multifaceted intervention that addresses each of these aims may be required, though there is insufficient evidence to support this approach."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the effectiveness of any of the interventions reviewed in this review. Further research is needed to establish the effectiveness and effectiveness of various interventions in the management of pain and function of people with chronic pain and to assess their effectiveness in various settings. Finally, there is a need for further research in this area, particularly in areas with a high incidence of chronic pain, such as hospitals and clinics, as well as in regions with a low incidence of acute pain and chronic pain."
105," Oxygen can relieve dyspnoea in mildly and non-hypoxaemic people with COPD who would not otherwise qualify for home oxygen therapy. Given the significant heterogeneity among the included studies, clinicians should continue to evaluate patients on an individual basis until supporting data from ongoing, large randomised controlled trials are available."," Breathing oxygen is effective in reducing breathlessness and improving lung function in people with COPD. However, there is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of breathing oxygen as a substitute for oxygen in the treatment of breathlessness or dyspnoea. Further research is needed to determine the optimal dose and duration of breathing gas and to compare breathing oxygen with oxygen, oxygen and oxygen therapy in patients who are at risk of developing hypoxaemia or developing hypoxic symptoms. Finally, future research should evaluate the effectiveness of oxygen inhalation as an adjunct to oxygen therapy."
106," The evidence suggests that artemisinin drugs are no worse than quinine in preventing death in severe or complicated malaria. No artemisinin derivative appears to be better than the others. This review summarizes trials up to 1999. For the reasons in the 'What's new' section, this review will no longer be updated."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of antimalarial drugs in the treatment of people with malaria. Further research is needed to establish the effectiveness and safety of these drugs in terms of reducing mortality and disability in patients with malaria, and to compare them with each other. In addition, future research should focus on assessing the efficacy and safety, and on identifying the most effective drugs to use in these patients, as well as assessing the effectiveness of these medications in reducing mortality, disability and disability."
107," Breathing exercises over four to 15 weeks improve functional exercise capacity in people with COPD compared to no intervention; however, there are no consistent effects on dyspnoea or health-related quality of life. Outcomes were similar across all the breathing exercises examined. Treatment effects for patient-reported outcomes may have been overestimated owing to lack of blinding. Breathing exercises may be useful to improve exercise tolerance in selected individuals with COPD who are unable to undertake exercise training; however, these data do not suggest a widespread role for breathing exercises in the comprehensive management of people with COPD."," Exercise training may improve lung function in people with dyspnea, but there is insufficient evidence to recommend exercise training as an exercise training exercise programme. Exercise training appears to have a beneficial effect on lung function and fitness capacity, but its effects on health-related quality of life are unclear. Exercise programs appear to be beneficial in improving lung function, but their effect on fitness capacity is not clear. Further research is needed to assess the effects of exercise training on fitness performance and fitness, and to compare exercise training with other forms of exercise."
108," Stepwise and partial excavation reduced the incidence of pulp exposure in symptomless, vital, carious primary as well as permanent teeth. Therefore these techniques show clinical advantage over complete caries removal in the management of dentinal caries. There was no evidence of a difference in signs or symptoms of pulpal disease between stepwise excavation, and complete caries removal, and insufficient evidence to determine whether or not there was a difference in signs and symptoms of pulp disease between partial caries removal and complete caries removal. When partial caries removal was carried out there was also insufficient evidence to determine whether or not there is a difference in risk of restoration failure. The no dentinal caries removal studies investigating permanent teeth had a similar result with no difference in restoration failure. The other no dentinal caries removal study, which investigated primary teeth, showed a statistically significant difference in restoration failure favouring the intervention. Due to the short term follow-up in most of the included studies and the high risk of bias, further high quality, long term clinical trials are still required to assess the most effective intervention. However, it should be noted that in studies of this nature, complete elimination of risk of bias may not necessarily be possible. Future research should also investigate patient centred outcomes."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of any particular type of toothpaste in the treatment of tooth decay. Further research is needed to identify the most effective toothpaste and the best way to apply it to tooth decay in tooth decay, and to compare the effectiveness of different types and methods of tooth extraction. Finally, there is a need for further research into the effectiveness and durability of toothpastes, and also to compare toothpaste with other toothpaste products."
109," There are no data from placebo controlled trials regarding the efficacy of naftopidil in men with symptomatic BPH. Limited information suggests that treatment with naftopidil provides short-term improvement in urinary symptom-scale scores (total IPSS/AUA), QoL (quality of life) score, and urinary symptoms from baseline comparable to low-dose tamsulosin. Adverse effects due to naftopidil were few and usually mild."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the existence of a protective effect of hydrocortisone in the treatment of LUTS. Further research is needed to determine the effectiveness of hydocortisones in reducing the risk of overactive bladder syndrome, and to assess the effectiveness and safety of hydroportisole in the management of bladder dysplasia and residual urine volume. Finally, long-term data are needed to evaluate the efficacy and safety, and also to assess its effectiveness in bladder function and quality of life."
110," We found no evidence of a difference in time to discharge from hospital, assessed by clinical criteria, in patients who received anxiolytic premedication. However, in view of the age and variety of anaesthetic techniques used and clinical heterogeneity between studies, inferences for current day case practice should be made with caution."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of digital-symbol substitution tests in the treatment of anxiety or distress. Further research is needed to establish the effectiveness and reliability of these tests and to compare the effects of digital substitution with other types of electrostimulation in the management of anxiety and distress in patients with anaesthesia. Finally, there is a need for an assessment of the effectiveness, reliability and durability of digital symbols substitution tests, as well as a comparison of digital and analog substitution tests with each other."
111," There is silver level evidence (www.cochranemsk.org) to support the efficacy of strontium ranelate for the reduction of fractures (vertebral and to a lesser extent, non-vertebral) in postmenopausal osteoporotic women and an increase in BMD in postmenopausal women with/without osteoporosis. Diarrhea may occur, however, adverse events leading to study withdrawal were not significantly increased. Potential vascular and neurological side-effects need to be further explored."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of mineral baths in the treatment of vertebral fractures. Further research is needed to determine whether mineral baths are beneficial or harmful for vertebral fracture prevention, and whether they are beneficial in terms of bone mineral density, bone integrity, bone density, and bone density in particular in patients with non-vertebral fractures, or those with osteoporosis or bone fragility, or whether bone density is reduced in these patients."
112," Dopamine is more effective than dobutamine in the short term treatment of systemic hypotension in preterm infants. There was no evidence of an effect on the incidence of adverse neuroradiological sequelae (severe periventricular haemorrhage and/or periventricular leucomalacia), or on the incidence of tachycardia. However, in the absence of data confirming long term benefit and safety of dopamine compared to dobutamine, no firm recommendations can be made regarding the choice of drug to treat hypotension."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of intravenous immunoglobulin in the treatment of SMA. Further randomized controlled trials are needed to determine the effectiveness of this therapy in reducing blood pressure and blood pressure in SMA, and to compare the effectiveness and safety of this treatment with other treatments. Finally, long-term follow-up is needed to assess the effects of this intervention on SMA and to determine its effectiveness in the long term. Long-term data are also required to assess its effectiveness, safety and effectiveness."
113," There were more deaths and more rebleeding in the transfusion arms of the combined studies, but the small numbers of participants and large volume of missing data limit the significance of the findings. The studies in this review do not provide useful data regarding outcomes following red blood cell transfusion for acute upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage. They appear to exclude large survival benefit. Large, well-concealed RCTs of sufficient power are urgently needed."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of vasopressor systems for reducing blood loss or blood transfusion in patients with acute hemodynamic hypertension. Further research is needed to determine the best method of pumping blood into veins, the best way to reduce blood loss, and the most effective way to achieve this. Finally, there is a need for further research in this area. The results of this review should be interpreted with caution, as the conclusions are based on a small number of patients and are subject to considerable variation in outcome measures."
114," While COCs containing 20 μg EE may be theoretically safer, this review did not focus on the rare events required to assess this hypothesis. Data from existing randomized controlled trials are inadequate to detect possible differences in contraceptive effectiveness. Low-dose estrogen COCs resulted in higher rates of bleeding pattern disruptions. However, most trials compared COCs containing different progestin types, and changes in bleeding patterns could be related to progestin type as well as estrogen dose. Higher follow-up rates are essential for meaningful interpretation of results."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of intrauterine excisioning as a contraceptive strategy in women with a history of recurrent menstrual bleeding. Further research is needed to establish the effectiveness and safety of this treatment option, and to compare it with other hormonal contraception options. Finally, to determine the best way to administer excisionation as a hormonal contraceptive strategy, a meta-analysis should be undertaken to determine its effectiveness and cost-effectiveness."
115," The evidence in this review does not support the use of prophylactic maternal phenobarbital administration to prevent PVH in preterm infants or to protect them from neurological disability in childhood. Phenobarbital administration may lead to maternal sedation. If any future trials are carried out, they should measure neurodevelopmental status at follow up."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of phenobarbital in the treatment of SE/IVH. Further randomized controlled trials are needed to determine the optimal dose and duration of phenytoin therapy, and to assess the effectiveness and safety of the various methods of administration in this population. Such trials are also needed to evaluate the effects of phenoxycycline on mortality and morbidity, and also to compare phenoxyclonic acid with other treatments."
116," Over a short follow-up period, the use of benzodiazepines may reduce the symptoms of antipsychotic-induced acute akathisia. This review highlights the need for well designed, conducted and reported clinical trials to address the claims of open studies."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the effectiveness of acupuncture for the treatment of akathisia. Further research is needed to determine the effectiveness and safety of acupuncture in this population, as well as to assess the efficacy of acupuncture as a standalone treatment for akathiasia, and to compare acupuncture with other treatments, such as chiropractic treatment, or to assess its effectiveness as an adjunct to other treatments. Finally, future research is required to assess whether acupuncture has an effect on the quality of life of people with akathia, or on the severity of its symptoms."
117," We found low-level evidence for the use of teriflunomide as a disease-modifying therapy for MS, due to the limited quality of the available RCTs. We did not conduct meta-analysis because of the clinical and methodological diversity of the included studies. Short-term teriflunomide, 7 or 14 mg alone or with add-on IFN-β, was safe for patients with relapsing MS. Both teriflunomide 7 and 14 mg alone had potential benefits for patients with relapsing forms of MS. We are waiting for the publication of ongoing trials. RCTs with high methodological quality and longer periods of observation are needed to assess safety, disability progression, neuroprotection and quality of life.", There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of ipratropium for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory RRMS. Further randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm the effectiveness of ipatropium in treating relapses and relapse in patients with RRMS who are unable to tolerate it or who are unwilling or unable to accept it. Such trials should be undertaken in the absence of evidence to determine the efficacy and safety of this drug.
118," The optimum treatment for LGS remains uncertain and no study to date has shown any one drug to be highly efficacious; rufinamide, lamotrigine, topiramate and felbamate may be helpful as add-on therapy, clobazam may be helpful for drop seizures. Until further research has been undertaken, clinicians will need to continue to consider each patient individually, taking into account the potential benefit of each therapy weighed against the risk of adverse effects."," Rufinamide is effective in reducing the frequency of drop attacks and reducing the number of dropouts. It is also associated with a reduction in the severity of the drop attacks, but this is based on a small number of small studies with a high risk of bias and a low risk of random errors. Its efficacy is similar to that of other drugs, but with a higher risk of adverse events and a lower risk of seizure frequency. Its use is associated with an increased risk of seizures and a decreased risk of death. Its effectiveness is similar with other drugs. Its safety is similar in terms of efficacy and safety. Its long-term safety is unknown."
119," Only tentative conclusions can be drawn from the available evidence in this review. Compared with ORIF, there was some evidence that radial head replacement had better elbow function and fewer adverse events for Mason type III radial head fractures in the short term. However, the evidence is of low quality and it is unknown whether these results would apply in the longer term or more generally. Using biodegradable implants may be as good as metallic implants for fixation of some usually more stable fractures but more evidence is needed to confirm this. There is a need for good quality evidence for addressing the areas of uncertainty for the surgical treatment of radial head fractures."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the existence of any difference in accuracy between Brooks and Kiriuchi. Further randomized controlled trials are needed to determine whether or not Brooks is better suited to the position of Brooks in the orthopaedic field, or whether he is worse suited for the role of a surgeon in this field. Such trials are also needed to evaluate the effects of Brooks on accuracy and accuracy of Brooks' position in orthopedic surgery, and to compare Brooks with other surgical procedures."
120," Interventions to enhance communication involving children and adolescents with cancer have not been widely or rigorously assessed. The weak evidence that exists suggests that some children and adolescents with cancer may derive some benefit from specific information-giving programs, from support before and during particular procedures, and from interventions that aim to facilitate their reintegration into school and social activities. More research is needed to investigate the effects of these and other related interventions."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the effectiveness of psychotherapy for psychological distress. Further research is needed to determine the effectiveness and effectiveness of psychological therapy for psychological stress disorder. It is also important to understand the mechanisms by which psychotherapy works, and how it relates to psychological distress disorder and coping skills, as well as how it compares to other psychological therapies, and to compare psychotherapy with other psychological treatments, including antidepressant drugs and psychological therapies."
121," Primaquine (15 mg/day for 14 days) plus chloroquine is more effective than chloroquine alone or primaquine (15 mg/day for 5 days) plus chloroquine in preventing relapses of vivax malaria. Primaquine (five days) plus chloroquine appears no better than chloroquine. Countries should follow the WHO's recommendation for 14-day primaquine plus chloroquine regimen. Alternative regimens need to be evaluated in randomized controlled trials, which should also consider variations in regional P. vivax strains and the possibility of primaquine resistance, reinfection, and adherence in those who relapse."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the effectiveness of tafenoquine for the treatment of P. vivax malaria. Further research is needed to identify the optimal dose and duration of treatment and to assess the effectiveness and safety of taffenoquines in the management of this condition. Finally, there is a need for further research into the efficacy and effectiveness of long-acting beta-lactams, particularly in combination with chloroquine, and to evaluate the effectiveness, safety and efficacy of these drugs in the control group."
122," Despite identifying 34 trials related to treatments for blepharitis, there is no strong evidence for any of the treatments in terms of curing chronic blepharitis. Commercial products are marketed to consumers and prescribed to patients without substantial evidence of effectiveness. Further research is needed to evaluate the effectiveness of such treatments. Any RCT designed for this purpose should separate participants by type of condition (e.g. staphylococcal blepharitis or MGD) in order to minimize imbalances between groups (type I errors) and to achieve statistical power for analyses (prevent type II errors). Medical interventions and commercial products should be compared with conventional lid hygiene measures, such as warm compresses and eyelid margin washing, to determine effectiveness, as well as head-to-head to show comparative effectiveness between treatments. Outcomes of interest should be patient-centered and measured using validated questionnaires or scales. It is important that participants be followed long-term, at least one year, to assess chronic outcomes properly."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of thermal baths in the treatment of tear-up conditions. Further research is needed to determine whether thermal baths are more effective than thermal baths for tearing-up periods, or whether thermal bathing is more effective or safer than thermal bathing in terms of reducing tear-ups conditions, and to compare thermal baths with thermal baths or thermal baths alone or in combination with a thermal bath or thermal bath. Further studies are also needed to assess the effectiveness of thermal bathing, thermal baths and thermal baths compared to thermal bathing alone or with thermal bathing."
123," There is no reliable evidence from the trials included in this review that any specific initial arch wire material is better or worse than another with regard to speed of alignment or pain. There is no evidence at all about the effect of initial arch wire materials on the important adverse effect of root resorption. Further well-designed and conducted, adequately-powered, RCTs are required to determine whether the performance of initial arch wire materials as demonstrated in the laboratory, makes a clinically important difference to the alignment of teeth in the initial stage of orthodontic treatment in patients."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the effectiveness of tooth alignment for the treatment of cavities in toothbrushes. Further research is needed to determine the effectiveness and safety of toothbrushing for cavities, as well as to assess the efficacy and effectiveness of other types of dental cleaning products, and to compare the effectiveness to other forms of cleaning products. Finally, future research should focus on the evaluation of the effectiveness, safety, and efficacy of various cleaning products for cavions in teethbrushing."
124," Studies were generally small and very few studies were done in developing countries. There was a lack of studies truly looking at the effect of home based care itself or looking at significant end points (death and progression to AIDS). However, the range of interventions and HBC models evaluated can assist in making evidence-based decisions about HIV care and support."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of micronutrient supplements in the management of physical fitness. Further research is needed to establish the effectiveness of microneutrient supplementation in improving physical fitness and improving quality of life in people with HIV/AIDS, and to assess the effects on health-related quality and quantity of life. Finally, there is a need for further research into the effectiveness and durability of microtrient supplements, as well as to evaluate the efficacy and durability, and also to assess their effectiveness in other areas of fitness and health-associated quality of Life."
125," Improvement in control of maternal blood pressure with use of beta-blockers would be worthwhile only if it were reflected in substantive benefits for mother and/or baby, and none have been clearly demonstrated. The effect of beta-blockers on perinatal outcome is uncertain; the worrying trend to an increase in SGA infants is partly dependent on one small outlying trial. Large randomised trials are needed to determine whether antihypertensive therapy in general (rather than beta-blocker therapy specifically) results in greater benefit than risk, for treatment of mild-moderate pregnancy hypertension. If so, then it would be appropriate to consider which antihypertensive is best, and beta-blockers should be evaluated. [Note: the seventeen reports in the awaiting classification section of the review may alter the conclusions of the review once assessed.]"," Propranolol is effective in reducing blood pressure in preterm or newborn patients with hypertension, but its use is associated with a reduction in the number of deaths and the rate of hypoglycaemia. Its use is also associated with an increased risk of maternal death, a decreased risk of neonatal death, and a decrease in the incidence of maternal hyperglycaemia, an increase in neonatal mortality and a decreased rate of maternal mortality. Its effect on maternal mortality is not clear from this review, but is likely to be underestimated."
126," Ketanserin may have some efficacy in the treatment of Raynaud's phenomenon secondary to scleroderma. Overall, ketanserin is not significantly different from placebo for the treatment of Raynaud's phenomenon except for some decrease in the duration of attacks and more subjects improved on ketanserin compared to placebo. However, there were more side effects, and the frequency of attacks actually favored placebo. It can be concluded that ketanserin treatment in Raynaud's phenomenon secondary to scleroderma is not clinically beneficial."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the existence of a mechanism of blood pressure lowering in cold-blooded people with Raynaud's phenomenon. Further research is needed to identify the mechanism by which blood pressure lowers in this population and to compare the effectiveness of this intervention with other treatments. Finally, there is a need for a meta-analysis of the effects of other types of bloodpressure lowering techniques, such as hydrocolloid gel gel gel and gel-based gel-containing gel gel."
127," Omega-3 fatty acids appear to have little haematological benefit in people with intermittent claudication and there is no evidence of consistently improved clinical outcomes (quality of life, walking distance, ankle brachial pressure index or angiographic findings). Supplementation may also cause adverse effects such as nausea, diarrhoea and flatulence. Further research is needed to evaluate fully short- and long-term effects of omega-3 fatty acids on the most clinically relevant outcomes in people with intermittent claudication before they can be recommended for routine use."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the existence of a protective effect of omega-3 fatty acids in reducing arterial blood pressure in people with peripheral arterial hypertension. Further randomized controlled trials are needed to determine the effects of omega 3 fatty acids on blood pressure, platelet count, blood pressure and platelet sensitivity in patients with peripheral artery hypertension. Finally, long-term data are required to assess the effects on platelet counts and blood sugar levels in patients who are at high risk of cardiovascular disease."
128," Antibiotic prophylaxis in afebrile neutropenic patients significantly reduced all-cause mortality. In our review, the most significant reduction in mortality was observed in trials assessing prophylaxis with quinolones. The benefits of antibiotic prophylaxis outweighed the harm such as adverse effects and the development of resistance since all-cause mortality was reduced. As most trials in our review were of patients with haematologic cancer, we strongly recommend antibiotic prophylaxis for these patients, preferably with a quinolone. Prophylaxis may also be considered for patients with solid tumours or lymphoma."," Antibiotic prophylaxis is effective in reducing the incidence and severity of bacterial infections in patients with acute and chronic kidney disease. However, there is a need for further research to evaluate the effectiveness of pro-phylactic antibiotics in this population, and to compare the effectiveness and safety of these drugs with each other in terms of mortality, morbidity and mortality. Finally, to determine the effectiveness, safety and effectiveness of antibiotics in the treatment of acute kidney disease, a randomized controlled trial is needed to assess the efficacy and safety, as well as to compare these drugs to each other."
129," Results of this review do not provide sufficient evidence in favour of anticonvulsants for the treatment of AWS. There are some suggestions that carbamazepine may actually be more effective in treating some aspects of alcohol withdrawal when compared to benzodiazepines, the current first-line regimen for alcohol withdrawal syndrome. Anticonvulsants seem to have limited side effects, although adverse effects are not rigorously reported in the analysed trials."," Oxcarbazepam appears to have a beneficial effect on sleepiness and tolerability in the treatment of alcohol withdrawal syndrome. However, its use is associated with a significant increase in adverse events, such as sleepiness, fatigue, insomnia and sleepiness. Its use is not associated with an increase in sleepiness or fatigue, but its use may be associated with increased risk of sleepiness in some patients. Its efficacy is not clear from this review, as the majority of the articles in this review were published in the United Kingdom and elsewhere."
130," The risk of stroke and death did not differ significantly between the two types of anaesthetic technique during carotid endarterectomy. This review provides evidence to support a policy that patients and surgeons can choose either anaesthetic technique, depending on the clinical situation and their own preferences."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the existence of a difference in blood pressure in myocardial ischemia, but there is a need for further research. There is no evidence to suggest that blood pressure lowering is associated with a reduction in mortality or cardiovascular morbidity, but this is based on a small number of small studies with a high risk of bias. Further research is needed to determine the best way to quantify blood pressure, and to compare blood pressure reduction with other measures of mortality and cardiovascular morbidities."
131, Intramuscular methotrexate at a dose of 15 mg/week is safe and effective for maintenance of remission in Crohn's disease. Oral methotrexate (12.5 to 15 mg/week) does not appear to be effective for maintenance of remission in Crohn's disease.," There is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of progestogens in the treatment of REM. Further research is needed to determine the optimal dose, duration and timing, and the best progestogen formulation. Finally, there is a need for a meta-analysis of the effects of progesterone in REM. This should be done in accordance with the recommendations of the Cochrane Classification Working Group (CBRG) and the International Classification of Diseases (ICSD) Working Group. It is also important to note that there is no clear evidence of a difference in efficacy between the two treatments."
132," This review suggests that the use of fluoride supplements is associated with a reduction in caries increment when compared with no fluoride supplement in permanent teeth. The effect of fluoride supplements was unclear on deciduous teeth. When compared with the administration of topical fluorides, no differential effect was observed. We rated 10 trials as being at unclear risk of bias and one at high risk of bias, and therefore the trials provide weak evidence about the efficacy of fluoride supplements."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of any particular type of antiplatelet agent in the treatment of caries. Further research is needed to establish the effectiveness of this agent in reducing caries incidence and severity, and to compare its effectiveness with other antiplatelets agents. Finally, to determine the effectiveness and safety of fluoride toothpastes, a randomized controlled trial is warranted to determine whether fluoride toothpaste is beneficial or harmful in reducing the incidence of autoies or caries in children."
133," There is evidence for significant beneficial effects of regular exercise on physical fitness, walking capacity, cardiovascular dimensions (e.g. blood pressure and heart rate), health-related quality of life and some nutritional parameters in adults with CKD. Other outcomes had insufficient evidence due to the lack of data from RCTs. The design of the exercise intervention causes difference in effect size and should be considered when prescribing exercise with the aim of affecting a certain outcome. Future RCTs should focus more on the effects of resistance training interventions or mixed cardiovascular- and resistance training as these exercise types have not been studied as much as cardiovascular exercise."," The results of this review support the use of exercise as a measure of exercise performance and fitness capacity. Exercise as a standalone measure of fitness capacity is associated with a reduction in blood pressure and a decreased risk of cardiovascular disease. Exercise is also associated with an increase in cardiovascular disease, a decrease in stroke, and a reduced risk of cardiac arrhythmias. Exercise programmes are associated with improved fitness capacity and reduced risk factors for cardiovascular disease and cardiovascular disease in the short term. Exercise programs are associated by a reduction of blood pressure, but the exact magnitude of this reduction is unclear. Exercise program programs are not associated with increased risk of heart attack or stroke, but they are likely to have a negative impact on fitness capacity, cardiovascular health, physical functioning and quality of life. Exercise may be considered as an option for exercising, but further research is needed."
134," The review suggests a substantial caries-inhibiting effect of fluoride varnish in both the permanent and the deciduous dentitions based largely on trials with no treatment controls. There is little information concerning acceptability of treatment or possible side effects in the included trials. Given the relatively poor quality of most of the included studies and the wide confidence intervals around the estimates of effect, there remains a need for further trials. It is important that these trials should be of high quality and include assessment of potential adverse effects."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of sugar as a substitute for toothpastes in the treatment of caries progression. Further research is needed to identify the optimal sugar composition and dosage, and to compare the effects of sugar on caries development. Finally, there is a need for further research into the effectiveness of cocoa as a replacement for toothpaste, and also to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of other forms of toothpaste. Finally there is an urgent need for a well-designed, well-conducted and reported randomised controlled trial to assess the efficacy of cocoa for the treatment and prevention of tooth decay in children."
135," There is currently insufficient evidence from which to draw firm conclusions about the impact of postoperative face-down positioning on the outcome of surgery for macular hole. Of three RCTs, two suggested a benefit in larger holes but none demonstrated evidence of a benefit in smaller holes. CONSORT adherent RCTs and large scale, well designed non-randomised observational studies are needed to determine with confidence the value of this intervention."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of laser photocoagulation as an adjunct to traditional surgical closure. Further research is needed to determine the effectiveness and safety of this technique in the treatment of anatomic closure, and to assess the effectiveness of photocoaggulation as a substitute for surgical closure as an alternative to surgical closure in terms of loss of visual acuity, loss of vision and loss of reflexivity. Finally, there is a need for a well-designed, well-conducted, transparent and transparent assessment of the effects of this method of closure on loss of sight."
136," Overall, there is preliminary evidence that a variety of cognitive-behavioral interventions can be used with children and adolescents to successfully manage or reduce pain and distress associated with needle-related procedures. However, many of the included studies received lower quality scores because they failed to describe the randomization procedure and participant withdrawals or drop-outs from the study. Further RCTs need to be conducted, particularly for the many interventions for which we could not locate any trials."," Psychotherapy is effective in reducing pain severity in children and adolescents. Psychotherapy may also reduce pain intensity in adults, but there is no clear evidence of a difference in pain severity between psychotherapy and psychological therapy alone. Practical psychotherapy may be more effective than psychological therapy, but more research is needed to assess the effects of psychotherapy on pain severity and psychological wellbeing, and to compare psychotherapy with psychological therapy. Research is also needed to evaluate the effectiveness of psychological therapy compared to psychological therapy in children, as well as to compare psychological therapy with psychotherapy alone."
137," Calcium supplementation is associated with a significant protective benefit in the prevention of pre-eclampsia, and should be used for this indication according to a previous review. This review indicates that there are no additional benefits for calcium supplementation in prevention of preterm birth or low infant birth weight. While there was a statistically significant difference of 80 g identified in mean infant birth weight, there was significant heterogeneity identified, and the clinical significance of this difference is uncertain."," Vitamin D supplementation is effective in reducing blood pressure and bone mineral density in pre-eclampsia and preterm birth. Vitamin D supplements do not appear to have a significant effect on blood pressure, bone density, or proteinuria in preterm delivery or preterm births. However, there is a need for further research into the effects of vitamin D supplementation on bone density and proteinuria, maternal morbidity and mortality, and maternal and neonatal mortality."
138," Compared with the contrast-assisted cannulation technique, the guidewire-assisted cannulation technique increases the primary cannulation rate and reduces the risk of PEP, and it appears to be the most appropriate first-line cannulation technique."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of cannulation as a panacea for pancreatic opacification in pancreatic fibrosis. Further research is needed to identify the optimal cannulation method and the best way to achieve this. Finally, there is a need for further research into cannulation in fibrosis, pancreatic sphincterotomy, and pancreatic cannulation, as well as to compare cannulation with other methods of organoscopy."
139, There is currently no evidence from randomised trials to support routine use of physical or pharmacological strategies to reduce temperature in patients with acute stroke. Large randomised clinical trials are needed to study the effect of such strategies.," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the existence of a protective effect on body temperature in people with acute ischaemic stroke. Further research is needed to establish the effectiveness of this protective intervention in this population, and to assess the effects of this intervention on quality of life and health-related quality-of-life. Finally, to determine the effectiveness and safety of this treatment, a meta-analysis of the data is required to determine whether it is beneficial or harmful to use it as an adjunct to other treatments of stroke."
140," In those clinical settings where surgical expertise and equipment are available and affordable, diagnostic laparoscopy and LA (either in combination or separately) seem to have various advantages over OA. Some of the clinical effects of LA, however, are small and of limited clinical relevance. In spite of the mediocre quality of the available research data, we would generally recommend to use laparoscopy and LA in patients with suspected appendicitis unless laparoscopy itself is contraindicated or not feasible. Especially young female, obese, and employed patients seem to benefit from LA."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of antibiotics in the recovery of appendic appendicectomy. Further research is needed to determine the effectiveness of antibiotics for appendicotomy, and to compare the effectiveness and safety of antibiotics with other types of antibiotics. Finally, there is a need for a meta-analysis of the effects of antibiotic prophylaxis on appendic rupture and recovery time, as well as to compare different types of antibiotic and duration of antibiotic treatment."
141," With its lower complication rate in comparison with intramedullary nails, and absence of functional outcome data to the contrary, the SHS appears superior for trochanteric fractures. Further studies are required to confirm whether more recently developed designs of intramedullary nail avoid the complications of previous nails. Intramedullary nails may have advantages over fixed angle plates for subtrochanteric and some unstable trochanteric fractures, but further studies are required."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of orthopaedic screws for reducing blood loss in the first post-operative period of recovery. Further research is needed to determine the optimal design and timing of these screws and to compare them with other types of screws and plates in terms of blood loss and functional status. Finally, there is a need for a well-designed, well-conducted, transparent and transparent assessment of all aspects of recovery, including blood loss, functional status and mortality."
142," There was a small reduction in the length of the third stage of labour and also in the amount of blood loss when cord drainage was applied compared with no cord drainage. The clinical importance of such observed statistically significant reductions, is open to debate. There is no clear difference in the need for manual removal of placenta, blood transfusion or the risk of postpartum haemorrhage. Due to small trials with medium risk of bias, the results should be interpreted with caution."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of oxytocin for the treatment of third stage of labour. Further randomized controlled trials are needed to determine the effectiveness of oxycodone for this purpose. Such trials should be conducted in the United States, Europe and Asia, and should include measures of maternal satisfaction with childbirth. They should also assess the effects on other maternal and neonatal outcomes, such as pain, exhaustion, sleep deprivation, sleepiness, fatigue, fatigue and sleep deprivation. Such tests should be undertaken in countries with low birth weights."
143," The studies included in this meta-analysis were generally small and methodologically prone to bias, which makes it impossible to arrive at a definitive conclusion about the effectiveness of manipulative therapies for infantile colic. The majority of the included trials appeared to indicate that the parents of infants receiving manipulative therapies reported fewer hours crying per day than parents whose infants did not, based on contemporaneous crying diaries, and this difference was statistically significant. The trials also indicate that a greater proportion of those parents reported improvements that were clinically significant. However, most studies had a high risk of performance bias due to the fact that the assessors (parents) were not blind to who had received the intervention. When combining only those trials with a low risk of such performance bias, the results did not reach statistical significance. Further research is required where those assessing the treatment outcomes do not know whether or not the infant has received a manipulative therapy. There are inadequate data to reach any definitive conclusions about the safety of these interventions."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the effectiveness of CPAP in reducing the amount of crying or waking up in wake-up infants. Further research is needed to determine the effectiveness and safety of this intervention in waking up infants with CPAP, as well as to assess its effectiveness in waking-up children. Finally, there is a need for a well-designed, well-conducted and reported systematic review of the efficacy and safety aspects of CPAC for waking up children with crying and waking up babies."
144," Telephone voice interventions may have a role in improving medication adherence, reducing risky sexual behaviour, and reducing depressive and psychiatric symptoms, but current evidence is sparse, and further research is needed."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the effectiveness of psychosocial interventions for the treatment of depression or suicidal ideation. Further research is needed to assess the effectiveness and reliability of these interventions and to compare them to each other in terms of adherence rates, relapse rates and relapse rates. Finally, future research should focus on assessing the effects of psychoses on depressive ideation and suicidal ideations, as well as on how psychoses are used in combination with other interventions, such as counselling and counselling."
145," Our review update included data from four new randomised studies of the ketogenic diet. Although none were blinded, some were of good quality. These studies suggest that in children, the ketogenic diet results in short to medium term benefits in seizure control, the effects of which are comparable to modern antiepileptic drugs. However, one study of long term outcome reports a high attrition rate for the diet. This would suggest that many children find the diet difficult to tolerate. The main reasons for drop-outs in the included studies included gastrointestinal side effects and dislike for the diet. We found just three studies on the use of the diet in adults and none of these were randomised. There has been less research involving other diets. We found one randomised study of reasonable quality of the Atkins diet. This study showed similar benefits in seizure control with a less restrictive diet. For those with medically intractable epilepsy or those in whom surgery is unsuitable, a ketogenic diet could improve seizure control, but tolerability is poor. One observational study suggested that the Atkins diet may have a similar effect on seizure control, but this requires more investigation."," There is insufficient evidence to recommend ketogenic diet as a substitute for ketamine for other ketogenic diets, or to support ketamine as an alternative to ketamine in terms of reduced frequency of seizures. Further research is needed to determine the optimal diet and the optimal dosage and timing of ketamine, and to compare ketogenic and ketamine with ketamine alone or in combination, and also to determine whether ketamine has an effect on frequency and severity of seizures, and on severity of adverse effects, or on quality of life."
146," We found four RCTs which reported mortality and bleeding data. It is not possible to determine whether human activated protein C, recombinant human soluble thrombomodulin, tranexamic acid and dermatan sulphate are effective or harmful for patients presenting with DIC related to acute or chronic leukemia. The effects of these interventions need to be tested in sufficiently powered RCTs. Outcome measures should include in-hospital mortality from any cause, overall mortality, incidence of resolution of respiratory failure, renal failure, shock and safety. The definition of bleeding should be standardized in these patients."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of thromboplastin in the treatment of DIC. There is a need for further research in this area, particularly in terms of the timing and duration of the thromboemboplastins, as well as in the timing of their thrombin insertion. In addition, there is an urgent need for a well-designed randomized controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of this therapy in DIC patients."
147, Oral corticosteroids at prednisolone-equivalent dose of 1 to 2 mg/kg alternate days appear to slow progression of lung disease in CF; benefit should be weighed against occurrence of adverse events. Risk-benefit analysis of low-dose alternate days corticosteroids is important and the short-term use of oral corticosteroids should be better evaluated.," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of cytokine antagonists in the treatment of IL-1 IgG. Further research is needed to determine the optimal cytokine antagonist for IL-2 IgG and to determine its role in IL-3 IgG treatment. Finally, there is a need for a meta-analysis of the effects of cytokines antagonists on IL-4 IgG, IL-5 IgG or IL-6 IgG as well as IL-7 IgG in IL and IIG, and to assess the effectiveness and safety of these antagonists."
148, DSE may perform better than MPS but additional studies directly comparing these cardiac screening tests are needed. Absence of significant CAD may not necessarily correlate with cardiac-event free survival following transplantation. Further research should focus on assessing the ability of functional tests to predict postoperative outcome.," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of antiplatelet agents in the treatment of DSE. Further research is needed to identify the best antiplatelets agent to apply to DSE patients, and to evaluate the effects of these agents on mortality, cardiovascular morbidity, and cardiovascular complications. Finally, there is a need for further research into the effectiveness and safety of anticoagulants for DSE, as well as to assess the effectiveness of these drugs in reducing mortality and morbidity."
149," Educational or counselling interventions may improve completion of treatment for latent tuberculosis. As would be expected, the magnitude of the benefit is likely to depend on the nature of the intervention, and the reasons for low completion rates in the specific setting."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of antibiotics in the treatment of tuberculosis. Further randomized controlled trials are needed to determine the effectiveness of antibiotics for tuberculosis treatment, and to assess the effects on quality of life and health-related quality. Such trials should be undertaken in the context of a well-defined set of outcomes, such as quality control, adherence to treatment and cost-effectiveness. They should also evaluate the effectiveness and safety of antibiotics, as well as the efficacy of antibiotic therapy in treating tuberculosis treatment."
150, Cervical manipulation and mobilisation produced similar changes. Either may provide immediate- or short-term change; no long-term data are available. Thoracic manipulation may improve pain and function. Optimal techniques and dose are unresolved. Further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate.," Headache training appears to have a beneficial effect on pain intensity and function in the short-term, but its effects are not clear in the long-term. The results of this review suggest that there is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of headache training as an adjunct to chiropractic therapy. Further research is needed to assess the effects of headaches training on pain severity and function, as well as the effectiveness of various types of neck training exercises."
151," The authors found three randomised controlled trials, albeit of moderate to poor quality, that suggest a short-term benefit of oral steroids in patients with multiple nasal polyps. To address the issue more thoroughly well-designed, prospective, randomised controlled trials are still needed."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of corticosteroids for the treatment of nasal obstruction in nasal secretions. Further research is needed to determine the optimal dose and duration of corticoosteroids and to assess the effectiveness of these drugs in the management of obstructive nasal obstruction. Finally, there is a need for further research into the effectiveness and safety of steroid therapy for nasal obstruction, as well as to evaluate the efficacy and safety profile of these treatments."
152," There is an absence of evidence as to whether clioquinol (PBT1) has any positive clinical benefit for patients with AD, or whether the drug is safe. We have some concerns about the quality of the study methodology; there was an imbalance in treatment and control groups after randomisation (participants in the active treatment group had a higher mean pre-morbid IQ) and the secondary analyses of results stratified by baseline dementia severity. The planned phase III trial of PBT1 has been abandoned and this compound has been withdrawn from development. The second trial of PBT2 was more rigorously conducted and showed that after 12 weeks this compound appeared to be safe and well tolerated in people with mild Alzheimer's dementia. Larger trials are now required to demonstrate cognitive efficacy."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of zinc supplements in the treatment of plasma agglomeration. Further randomized controlled trials are needed to determine whether zinc supplements are beneficial or harmful for human health or well-being, and to compare zinc supplements with placebo or no treatment. Finally, there is a need for a meta-analysis of the efficacy and toxicity of zinc supplementing powders, and an assessment of the effects of zinc supplementation on health-related quality of life and wellbeing."
153," Calcimimetic treatment of SHPT leads to significant improvements in biochemical parameters that observational studies have shown to be associated with increased mortality, cardiovascular risk and osteitis fibrosa, but patient-based benefits have not yet been demonstrated in trials. For patients with SHPT, the benefits of calcimimetics over standard therapy remain uncertain until further RCTs become available."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of vitamin D supplements for reducing plasma PTH levels in patients with PTH. Further randomized controlled trials are needed to determine whether vitamin D supplementation is beneficial for PTH and to assess the effects of supplementation on adverse events, including nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and diarrhea. Finally, long-term data are required to determine the optimal dose and duration of supplementation and to compare vitamin D supplementing supplements with calcium supplementation in patients undergoing dialysis."
154," Terbutaline pump maintenance therapy has not been shown to decrease the risk of preterm birth by prolonging pregnancy. Furthermore, the lack of information on the safety of the therapy, as well as its substantial expense, argues against its role in the management of arrested preterm labor. Future use should only be in the context of well-conducted, adequately powered randomized controlled trials. [Note: The two citations in the awaiting classification section of the review may alter the conclusions of the review once assessed.]"," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of micronutrient supplements in the treatment of gestational age. Further research is needed to identify the best micronotrient supplement to supplement supplementing supplements, and to assess the effects on other maternal and infant outcomes. Finally, there is a need for a meta-analysis of all the outcomes assessed in this review, including maternal and neonatal mortality and developmental outcomes, as well as to compare the effectiveness and safety of microneutrient supplementation with supplementing supplementing supplementation."
155," In patients with good-grade aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage, intraoperative mild hypothermia might prevent death or dependency in activities of daily living for a few of them. However, the confidence intervals include the possibility of both benefit and harm. There is no evidence that intraoperative mild hypothermia is harmful. This treatment should not be routinely applied. In patients with poor-grade aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage or without subarachnoid haemorrhage, there are insufficient data to draw any conclusions. A high-quality randomised clinical trial of intraoperative mild hypothermia for postoperative neurological deficits in patients with poor-grade aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage might be feasible."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of hypothermia as an adjunct to other resuscitation techniques in acute ICU beds. Further research is needed to determine the best method and timing of hypotherapy, and to assess the effects on other critical care outcomes, including mortality, cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, as well as to evaluate the effectiveness of these interventions in the long term. Finally, future research should focus on assessing the effectiveness and safety of these approaches, and on assessing their effectiveness in the context of intensive ICU bed rest."
156," Pacifier use in healthy term breastfeeding infants, started from birth or after lactation is established, did not significantly affect the prevalence or duration of exclusive and partial breastfeeding up to four months of age. However, evidence to assess the short-term breastfeeding difficulties faced by mothers and long-term effect of pacifiers on infants' health is lacking."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the existence of a correlation between frequency of exclusive breastfeeding and breastfeeding frequency. Further research is needed to establish the relationship between frequency and frequency of breastfeeding frequency, duration of breastfeeding, frequency of lactation support and frequency. It is also important to note that there is no clear evidence of a difference in breastfeeding frequency or duration between the two methods of breastfeeding. Further randomized controlled trials are needed to assess the effects of frequency and length of breastfeeding in tandem with breastfeeding frequency and duration, and to compare frequency and intensity of breastfeeding among the different methods of supplementing breastfeeding."
157, This review found no evidence that metformin treatment before or during ART cycles improves live birth or pregnancy rates. The risk of OHSS in women with PCOS and undergoing IVF or ICSI cycles was reduced with metformin. Further large RCTs are necessary to definitively answer if the use of metformin in PCOS women undergoing ART improves live birth and pregnancy rates.," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of IFH for the treatment of OHSS in vitro fertilisation. Further randomized controlled trials are needed to determine whether IFH is beneficial or harmful for OHSS and to compare IFH with IFH or IFH alone or in combination. Finally, there is a need for further research into IFH and IFH compared to IFH, IFH plus IFH as an adjuvant treatment for OSS in vivo fertilization."
158," Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs reduce bleeding and pain associated with IUD use. NSAIDs should be considered first-line therapy; if NSAIDs are ineffective, tranexamic acid may be considered as second-line therapy. Prophylactic ibuprofen administration with the first six menses after insertion appears unwarranted."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the effectiveness of IUD insertion for reducing blood loss or blood loss in menstrual blood loss. Further research is needed to determine the effectiveness and safety of this intervention for the treatment of blood loss and blood loss, and to assess its effectiveness in the management of menstrual bleeding and pain. Finally, to determine its effectiveness, its effectiveness and cost, and its usefulness in reducing bloodloss and blood transfusion, it is recommended that it is used in conjunction with other preventive measures, such as hydration, hydration and hydration."
159," Timed-cycle STI have not been proven to be safe in the short term. Although CD4-guided STI strategy has reported favorable outcomes in the short term, the long-term safety, efficacy and tolerability of this strategy has not been fully investigated. Based on the studies we reviewed, the evidence to support the use of timed-cycle STI and CD4-guided STI cycles as a standard of care in the management of chronic suppressed HIV infection is inconclusive."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of NRTI in CD4+ T cells, but there is a need for further research. This is especially true in the context of the introduction of new cell therapies, which are now standard therapy for CD4- T cell interruptions, and in CD8-T cell interruption therapy, which is now standard treatment protocol for CD3-T cells, and for CD7-RTI, which includes a number needed to treat."
160," The included studies provide strong evidence for increased ferritin and transferrin saturation levels, together with a small increase in haemoglobin, in patients with CKD who were treated with IV iron compared with oral iron. From a limited body of evidence, we identified a significant reduction in ESA requirements in patients treated with IV iron, and found no significant difference in mortality. Adverse effects were reported in only 50% of included studies. We therefore suggest that further studies that focus on patient-centred outcomes are needed to determine if the use of IV iron is justified on the basis of reductions in ESA dose and cost, improvements in patient quality of life, and with few serious adverse effects."," Iron supplementation is associated with a reduction in the incidence of adverse events, but no significant difference in mortality. Iron supplementation does not appear to have a significant impact on mortality or morbidity. However, iron supplementation does appear to be associated with an increase in iron consumption, although there is no evidence of a significant difference between iron supplementation and iron supplementation alone or in combination with iron supplementation. Further research is needed to determine the best iron supplementation regimen and the optimal iron composition and timing of iron supplementation, and to compare iron supplementation to iron supplementation with other iron supplements."
161," From this review, we conclude that when diabetes duration is over one year, the overall effect of self-monitoring of blood glucose on glycaemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes who are not using insulin is small up to six months after initiation and subsides after 12 months. Furthermore, based on a best-evidence synthesis, there is no evidence that SMBG affects patient satisfaction, general well-being or general health-related quality of life. More research is needed to explore the psychological impact of SMBG and its impact on diabetes specific quality of life and well-being, as well as the impact of SMBG on hypoglycaemia and diabetic complications."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of insulin-based glucose monitors in the management of weight loss in diabetic patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Further research is needed to identify the best insulin-containing glucose monitors and to compare them with insulin-controlled glucose monitors. Finally, long-term data are needed to evaluate the effectiveness of insulin and glucose monitors for weight loss and glucose control in diabetic populations with type 1 diabetes mellus mellitus and type 2 diabetic mellitus, as well as to assess the effectiveness and safety of insulin therapy in these populations."
162," In children over the age of two years with acute asthma exacerbations, inhaled anticholinergics as single agent bronchodilators were less efficacious than beta2-agonists. Inhaled anticholinergics were also less efficacious than inhaled anticholinergics combined with beta2-agonists. Inhaled anticholinergic drugs alone are not appropriate for use as a single agent in children with acute asthma exacerbations."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of ipratropium in the treatment of asthma. Further research is needed to identify the optimal dose, duration and timing of ipatropium, and to assess its effectiveness in the management of asthma exacerbations in patients with severe acute exacerbations. Finally, there is a need for a well-designed and executed randomised controlled trial to evaluate the effects of ipotropium on pulmonary function and quality of life in people with asthma."
163," In this review of randomized controlled trials of interventions designed to enhance partner support for smokers in cessation programmes, we failed to detect an increase in quit rates. Limited data from several of the trials suggest that these interventions also did not increase partner support. No conclusions can be made about the impact of partner support on smoking cessation. Additional studies with larger samples are needed to adequately explore the effects of partner support interventions for smoking cessation."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the effectiveness of psychological counselling for quitting behaviour. Further research is needed to establish the effectiveness and reliability of psychological counseling for quitting behaviours, as well as to assess its effectiveness in the context of a broader range of interventions, including psychological counselling, behavioural counselling and behavioural counselling, and other types of counselling. Finally, future research should focus on assessing the efficacy and effectiveness of psychotherapy for quitting behavior, and on assessing its effectiveness and safety."
164," GTR has a greater effect on probing measures of periodontal treatment than open flap debridement, including improved attachment gain, reduced pocket depth, less increase in gingival recession and more gain in hard tissue probing at re-entry surgery. However there is marked variability between studies and the clinical relevance of these changes is unknown. As a result, it is difficult to draw general conclusions about the clinical benefit of GTR. Whilst there is evidence that GTR can demonstrate a significant improvement over conventional open flap surgery, the factors affecting outcomes are unclear from the literature and these might include study conduct issues such as bias. Therefore, patients and health professionals need to consider the predictability of the technique compared with other methods of treatment before making final decisions on use. Since trial reports were often incomplete, we recommend that future trials should follow the CONSORT statement both in their conduct and reporting. There is therefore little value in future research repeating simple, small efficacy studies. The priority should be to identify factors associated with improved outcomes as well as investigating outcomes relevant to patients. Types of research might include large observational studies to generate hypotheses for testing in clinical trials, qualitative studies on patient-centred outcomes and trials exploring innovative analytic methods such as multilevel modelling. Open flap surgery should remain the control comparison in these studies."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the existence of a protective mechanism to protect against PPD reduction in the developing world. Further research is needed to establish the effectiveness and durability of protective mechanisms for restoring PPD in developing regions of the world, and to compare the effectiveness of these mechanisms with other interventions. Finally, there is a need for a well-designed, well-conducted and executed randomised controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of protective barriers in developing areas of the World Health Organization."
165," Although antibiotic treatment is effective for children with UTI, there are insufficient data to answer the question of which type of antibiotic or which duration is most effective to treat symptomatic lower UTI. This review found that 10-day antibiotic treatment is more likely to eliminate bacteria from the urine than single-dose treatments. No differences were observed for persistent bacteriuria, recurrence or re-infection between short and long-course antibiotics where the antibiotic differed between groups. This data adds to an existing Cochrane review comparing short and long-course treatment of the same antibiotic who also reported no evidence of difference between short and long-course antibiotics."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the effectiveness of antibiotic therapy in the treatment of uncomplicated UTIs. Further research is needed to determine the effectiveness and safety of antibiotic treatment in this population, as well as to compare antibiotic therapy with no treatment or no treatment. Finally, there is a need for a well-designed, well-conducted, transparent and reported randomised controlled trial comparing antibiotic therapy to antibiotic therapy alone or in combination with antibiotic therapy."
166, There was limited and low quality data providing insufficient evidence to assess the effectiveness of pedometer interventions in the workplace for increasing physical activity and improving subsequent health outcomes.," Physical activity is associated with a reduction in BMI and blood pressure, but no significant difference in BMI or blood pressure was found in physical activity. Physical activity may be associated with an improvement in BMI, blood pressure and triglyceride levels, but there is no evidence of a difference in blood pressure or triglyceride level. Physical activities are associated with significant decreases in BMI but no statistically significant difference was observed in fasting plasma glucose levels. Exercise programmes are not associated with any significant reduction in waist circumference or blood sugar levels, nor with a significant increase in triglycerides or triglycerides. Exercise programs should be undertaken in moderation, and exercise programmes should be supervised."
167," This review shows a trend towards greater effectiveness with dual chamber pacing compared to single chamber ventricular pacing, which supports the current British Pacing and Electrophysiology Group's Guidelines regarding atrioventricular block. Additional randomised controlled trial evidence from ongoing trials in this area will further inform the debate."," The results of this review suggest that there is no evidence to support or refute the use of DDDIR as a measure of cardiac output. However, the results are based on a small number of small studies with a high risk of bias and are therefore not necessarily representative of the whole range of outcomes measured in this review. Further research is needed to determine the best mode of action and the best way of delivering DDD IR to patients with a history of cardiac arrhythmias."
168," Pramipexole can be used to reduce off time, improve motor impairments and disability and reduce levodopa dose at the expense of increased dyskinetic adverse events. This conclusion is based on short and medium term trials (up to 24 weeks). Further trials are required to directly compare the newer with the older dopamine agonists."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of anticholinergics in the treatment of PD. Further research is needed to establish the effectiveness of these agents in the management of PD, and to assess the effects of these drugs on quality of life and disability. It is also important to understand the mechanisms by which these drugs are used to treat PD, as well as the mechanism by which they are used in the control of PD and its complications."
169," This review demonstrates a significant decrease in the incidence of symptomatic PDA following treatment of an asymptomatic PDA with indomethacin. There is also a small but statistically significant decrease in the duration of requirement for supplemental oxygen. There are no reported long term outcomes in the included trials, and so it is not possible to comment on possible long term effects. Further studies are required to determine the long term benefits or harms of closing a PDA prior to the onset of symptoms."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of mechanical ventilation in the treatment of non-obstructed ductus shunts. Further research is needed to determine whether mechanical ventilation is more effective than mechanical ventilation, or whether it is more efficient than surgical ventilation in terms of reducing the risk of death, respiratory distress syndrome, or other adverse outcomes. Finally, there is a need for further research in this area, particularly in the context of the development of new mechanical ventilation systems."
170," Of the four studies identified, one had low and three an unclear risk of bias. There is insufficient evidence from randomized controlled trials to show significant benefit from non-antiepileptic drugs in trigeminal neuralgia. More research is needed."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the effectiveness of acupuncture for the treatment of trigeminal neuralgia. Further research is needed to determine the effectiveness and safety of acupuncture, and to compare the effectiveness with other treatments, and also to compare acupuncture with other forms of acupuncture. Finally, there is a need for a well-designed, well-conducted, transparent and reported randomised controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of acupuncture in trigemeral neuralgias."
171," There is no evidence for any short-term or long-term advantage in peritoneal closure for non-obstetric operations. If further trials are performed on this topic, they should have an adequate period of follow-up and adequate measures should be taken to ensure that the results are not subject to bias."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the existence of any difference in pain relief between the two types of hydration systems for postoperative pain relief. There is a need for further well-designed, conducted and reported randomised controlled trials in this area. Such trials are needed to determine whether hydration is beneficial or harmful in terms of pain relief, function, quality of life, satisfaction with pain relief and satisfaction with the hydration system. They also need to evaluate the effectiveness of various hydration techniques, such as oxytocin, oxycodone, and hydration."
172, There is some evidence to suggest that ibuprofen dressings may offer pain relief to people with painful venous leg ulcers. EMLA (5%) appears to provide effective pain relief during the debridement of venous leg ulcers. Further research should consider standardised pain assessment methods and assess both the effect on ulcer healing and the impact of long term use of these treatments.," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of ibuprofen as an adjunct to standard anaesthetic therapy for pain relief in ulcer healing. Further research is needed to establish the effectiveness and safety of ibiprofen in ulcers healing with or without anticonvulsant therapy, as well as to assess the effectiveness of ibaprofen on pain relief and pain relief, and to assess its effectiveness in healing ulcer ulcers with anticoagulation therapy."
173," We included 25 RCTs and found no compelling evidence to support any one psychosocial treatment over another to reduce substance use (or improve mental state) by people with serious mental illnesses. Furthermore, methodological difficulties exist which hinder pooling and interpreting results; high drop out rates, varying fidelity of interventions, varying outcome measures, settings and samples and comparison groups may have received higher levels of treatment than standard care. Further studies are required which address these concerns and improve the evidence in this important area."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the effectiveness of CBT for the treatment of depression or alcohol dependence. Further research is needed to identify the best approach to CBT, the best way to integrate CBT and other psychosocial interventions, and the most effective way to deliver CBT to people with depression and alcohol dependence and to compare CBT with other types of psychoactive interventions. Finally, there is a need for a standardised assessment of the effectiveness and effectiveness of the CBT approach to mental health services, and to evaluate the efficacy of the various types of psychotherapy."
174," Overall, we found neither evidence that the addition of pTE to antineoplastic treatment reduced the risk of death or disease progression nor that it improved the rate of tumour responses to antineoplastic treatment. For thymosin α1, there was a trend for a reduced risk of dying and of improved DFS. There was preliminary evidence that pTE lowered the risk of severe infectious complications in patients undergoing chemotherapy or radiotherapy."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of thymosuppression in the treatment of T cell carcinoma. Further research is needed to determine the optimal dose, duration and timing of treatment and to assess the effectiveness of these agents in terms of survival and progression-free survival in patients with metastatic tumours. Finally, future trials should evaluate the effectiveness and safety of these treatments in patients who are undergoing chemotherapy for this condition, and to compare these treatments with each other. Finally they should assess the efficacy and toxicity of these therapies in patients undergoing chemotherapy."
175, There is no evidence that community-based screening of asymptomatic older people results in improvements in vision.," There is insufficient evidence to draw conclusions about the effectiveness of visual acuity testing in reducing the incidence of falls. Further research is needed to assess the effectiveness and safety of this intervention in reducing falls and improving sight acuity in people with a history of falls and impairments, and to compare the effectiveness with other types of assessment and assessment. Finally, future research should focus on assessing the effects of the intervention on quality of life, and on improving the quality and quantity of information provided to people with an impairment."
176," Compared to no intervention or minimal interventions (pamphlets, usual care), interactive computer-based interventions are an effective intervention for weight loss and weight maintenance. Compared to in-person interventions, interactive computer-based interventions result in smaller weight losses and lower levels of weight maintenance. The amount of additional weight loss, however, is relatively small and of brief duration, making the clinical significance of these differences unclear."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of computer-generated weight loss calculators in the management of weight loss in overweight or obese individuals. Further research is needed to determine the best way to implement such calculators, and to assess the effects of computer gaming consoles on body weight loss and waist circumference. Finally, future research should focus on measuring body weight, waist circumference, and metabolic control, and on measuring metabolic control and metabolism, as well as on the impact on waist circumference and body weight."
177," At the moment there is no evidence from individual RCTs in children and adults with different malignancies that underscores the use of an LBD for the prevention of infection and related outcomes. All studies differed with regard to co-interventions, outcome definitions, and intervention and control diets. Since pooling of results was not possible and all studies had serious methodological limitations, no definitive conclusions can be made. It should be noted that 'no evidence of effect', as identified in this review, is not the same as 'evidence of no effect'. Based on the currently available evidence, we are not able to give recommendations for clinical practice. More high-quality research is needed."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of antibiotics in the treatment of febrile neutropenia. Further randomized controlled trials are needed to determine whether antibiotics are beneficial or harmful in terms of reducing mortality and morbidity, and to assess the effectiveness of antibiotic therapy in this population. Such trials should be of high methodological quality, with a focus on identifying patients who are most likely to benefit from antibiotic therapy, as well as identifying those patients who will benefit most from antibiotic treatment."
178," Although acute bacterial conjunctivitis is frequently self limiting, the findings from this updated systematic review suggest that the use of antibiotic eye drops is associated with modestly improved rates of clinical and microbiological remission in comparison to the use of placebo. Use of antibiotic eye drops should therefore be considered in order to speed the resolution of symptoms and infection."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of azithromycin for the treatment of B. conjunctivitis. Further research is needed to identify the optimal dose, duration and timing, and the most effective antibiotic for the management of this condition. Finally, there is a need for further research into the efficacy and safety of these drugs in the management and management of these conditions, and to compare these drugs with each other in terms of efficacy, tolerability and safety."
179," Used alongside rehydration therapy, probiotics appear to be safe and have clear beneficial effects in shortening the duration and reducing stool frequency in acute infectious diarrhoea. However, more research is needed to guide the use of particular probiotic regimens in specific patient groups."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of ORS as an adjunct to ORS in the treatment of patients with acute diarrhoea. Further randomized controlled trials are needed to determine whether ORS is beneficial or harmful in terms of stool integrity and stool integrity, and to compare ORS with ORS, ORS and ORS alone or in combination, or to determine the optimal ORS regimen. Further research is also needed to assess the effectiveness and safety of ARS in this population. Finally, to compare the efficacy and safety and effectiveness of IVS with or without ORS or ORS for this population, a meta-analysis is needed."
180," Oral or intravenous furosemide cannot be recommended as treatment for transient tachypnoea of the newborn and it should not be used unless additional data become available. This finding suggests that either furosemide is not effective in promoting resorption of lung fluid, or factors other than delayed resorption of this fluid contribute to the pathogenesis of transient tachypnoea of the newborn. The question remains as to whether furosemide given to the infant (or even to the mother before caesarean section) might shorten the duration of the illness. As elective caesarean section continues at a high level, these two interventions might be worthy of trials."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of supplemental oxygen as a supplemental oxygen for the treatment of tachypnoea in TTN. Further research is needed to determine the optimal dose, duration and timing of oxygen supplementation and to assess the effectiveness of supplemental Oxygen as a supplementary oxygen for TTN in terms of weight loss, oxygen saturation and oxygen saturation in the first 24 hours after discharge from hospital. It is also important to note that supplemental oxygen is not recommended as a substitute for supplemental oxygen in patients who are unable to tolerate supplemental oxygen or oxygen."
181," Augmentation therapy with alpha-1 antitrypsin cannot be recommended, in view of the lack of evidence of clinical benefit and the cost of treatment."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of progestogens in the treatment of SEM. Further randomized controlled trials are needed to determine the efficacy and safety of these drugs in SEM, and to compare progestogen with placebo. Such trials should be of high quality, preferably with a high risk of bias, and should be conducted with a low risk of random errors and unreliable outcome measures. They should also evaluate the effectiveness of progesterone in the management of SEMS, and the impact on quality of life, and on the quality of the life of patients."
182, There is no convincing evidence to support the use of either atorvastatin or simvastatin as an adjunctive therapy in MS.," There is no evidence to support or refute the use of creatine for the treatment of relapses in adults with MS. Further research is needed to determine the optimal dose and duration of creatine therapy and to compare creatine with placebo. Finally, long-term data are needed to evaluate the effectiveness of creatine in preventing relapses and to determine its effectiveness in the management of MS. Long-term studies are also needed to assess the effectiveness and safety of creatine, as well as to assess its efficacy and safety."
183," We could not identify an antibiotic adjuvant therapy that could be recommended for the treatment of lung infection in those with cystic fibrosis. The emergence of increasingly resistant bacteria makes the reliance on antibiotics alone challenging for cystic fibrosis teams. There is a need to explore alternative strategies, such as the use of adjuvant therapies. Further research is required to provide future therapeutic options."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of ipratropium for the treatment of acute bronchoconstriction in RSIs. Further randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm the effectiveness and safety of ipatropium in this population. Such trials should be conducted in the United States, Europe, Asia and Australia, and should be of high methodological quality, with a focus on assessing the effectiveness, safety and effectiveness of the various treatments."
184," Limited data on the effect of ß-interferon treatment on PPMS exists. Only two single-centre placebo controlled trials of interferon beta have been done. Based on this review, the included studies showed that ß-interferon treatment was not associated with reduced disability progression in PPMS patients. However, the trial population was too small to allow definitive conclusions on the efficacy of ß-interferon therapy in PPMS patients. Larger research studies need to be done in patients with PPMS in order to clarify whether ß-interferon is effective in this population."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of any of the interventions reviewed in this review. Further randomized controlled trials are needed to determine the effectiveness of any interventions in the treatment of TMS. Such trials should be undertaken in the context of a well-defined set of outcome measures, such as fatigue and fatigue, as well as an assessment of quality of life. They should also assess the effects of various interventions on TMS, including walking, cycling, and social interaction."
185, Varenicline and behavioural interventions may help ST users to quit. Behavioural interventions incorporating telephone counselling or an oral examination are likely to increase abstinence rates.," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the effectiveness of any of the interventions included in this review. Further research is needed to establish the effectiveness and safety of various types of tobacco cessation interventions, and to assess the efficacy and effectiveness of these interventions in the context of a variety of contexts and settings. Finally, future research should evaluate the efficacy of nicotine replacement therapy, and its effectiveness in specific contexts, such as smoking cessation programmes, and the impact on health-related quality of life and wellbeing, as well as its effectiveness and cost."
186," There is some evidence to suggest that CSII may be better than MI for glycaemic control in people with type 1 diabetes. Non-severe hypoglycaemic events do not appear to be reduced with CSII. There is insufficient evidence regarding adverse events, mortality, morbidity and costs."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of insulin analogues in the treatment of patients with diabetes mellitus. Further research is needed to determine the optimal insulin- analogues for these patients, and to assess the effects on mortality, cardiovascular morbidity and morbidity. Finally, long-term data are needed to evaluate the effects of glucocorticoid therapy on glycaemic control in diabetic mellitus, and on metabolic control in patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes."
187," Some outcomes may be amenable to psychosocial treatments; however, there is insufficient evidence to recommend practice changes. Further research on interventions described in this review is required, including attention to timing, duration, setting and administering discipline(s), as well as treatment across care settings. To facilitate future evaluations, a core outcome set, including patient-reported outcomes such as quality of life and compliance, should be established for hip fracture trials."," Functional training may be a useful tool in the management of depression and anxiety, but its usefulness is limited by the small number of participants and the high risk of bias in most of the studies. Further research is needed to assess the effectiveness of functional training in depression, anxiety, sleep deprivation and sleep deprivation, and to compare functional training with functional training alone or in combination with other forms of mental health services. Finally, future research should evaluate the effectiveness and durability of exercises for depression, and the impact of exercise training on quality of life and wellbeing, as well as the impact on depression severity."
188," Complications for surgical first trimester abortion are rare. The included studies do not indicate overall benefits of one over the other method. MVA can be used for early first trimester surgical abortion, but maybe more difficult when used later in the first trimester. Duration of procedure is shorter with VA compared to D&C, which may be of importance when using local anaesthetics or for busy clinics. Outcomes such as women's satisfaction, the need for pain relief or surgeons preference for the instrument have been inadequately addressed. No long-term outcomes, such as fertility after surgical abortion, are available."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of epidural analgesia in the treatment of acute pain during anesthesia. Further research is needed to determine the effectiveness of epidurals for pain relief during anesthesia during anesthesia, and to assess the effectiveness and safety of intraoperative analgesia during anaesthesia for acute pain relief in women with acute pain following anesthesia. Finally, there is a need for a well-designed, well-conducted, transparent and transparent audit of the effectiveness, safety and effectiveness of various analgesia for this purpose."
189," Intensive reminders and 'implementation intention' interventions appear promising in enhancing adherence to antiepileptic mediations, however we need more reliable evidence on their efficacy from carefully designed randomised controlled trials before a firm conclusion can be reached."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the effectiveness of psychosocial interventions for the treatment of anxiety disorders in adults with epilepsy. There is a need for well-designed, well-conducted and reported randomised controlled trials to evaluate the effectiveness and effectiveness of these interventions. Such trials should be of high methodological quality, with appropriate attention paid to outcome measures. They should also evaluate the efficacy of psychological interventions for anxiety disorders, as well as measures of quality of life and wellbeing. They also should evaluate the effects of psychological therapies for anxiety disorder."
190," Both desipramine and paroxetine show a trend towards efficacy in depression in MS the short term, but both treatments were associated with adverse effects, with significantly more patients treated with paroxetine suffering from nausea or headache. Further clinical research on the treatment of depression in MS is clearly needed. Future trials should address the efficacy and tolerability in the long term and compare antidepressant treatments head-to-head."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the effectiveness of psychosocial interventions for depression or anxiety disorders in adults with MS. Further research is needed to assess the effectiveness and safety of psychotherapy for depression and anxiety disorders, as well as to assess its effectiveness in children with MS and adults with depression and its severity. It is also important to note that there is a need for a well-designed, well-conducted and reported randomised controlled trial to evaluate the effectiveness, safety and effectiveness of psychological therapies for depression in adults."
191," The low to very low quality of the evidence of studies included in this review provides insufficient evidence to determine with certainty which interventions are most effective in changing professional behaviour and in what contexts. However, interventions that may be worth further study are educational interventions involving more than one active element and that are repeatedly administered over time, and interventions employing specialised personnel, who are focused on an aspect of care that is supported by evidence e.g. dentists/dental auxiliaries performing oral care for VAP prevention."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the effectiveness of VAP in reducing mortality or morbidity in patients admitted to ICU. Further research is needed to determine the effectiveness and safety of this intervention in improving the quality of life of these patients, and to assess the impact on mortality and morbidity. Finally, future research should focus on assessing the impact of the intervention on mortality, morbidity and mortality in these patients and on cost-effectiveness of the treatment."
192, We found no evidence to support the use of hydroxyurea in addition to radiotherapy in the routine treatment of cervix cancer.," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the existence of any difference in survival between chemoprophylaxis and chemotherapy alone or in combination with chemotherapy alone. Further research is needed to determine the effectiveness and safety of chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone, and to compare the effectiveness of chemotherapy and radiation therapy in terms of survival and quality of life. Finally, a meta-analysis of the effects of radiation therapy versus chemotherapy is warranted. The results of this review are based on a small number of small studies with a high risk of bias, and are subject to a number of uncertainties."
193," There is insufficient evidence to assess the effectiveness of interventions for domestic violence on pregnancy outcomes. There is a need for high-quality, RCTs with adequate statistical power to determine whether intervention programs prevent or reduce domestic violence episodes during pregnancy, or have any effect on maternal and neonatal mortality and morbidity outcomes."," The evidence is insufficient to determine the effectiveness of psychological interventions for domestic violence. Further research is needed to assess the effectiveness and effectiveness of these interventions, and to compare them to each other, as well as to assess their effectiveness in the treatment of domestic violence and its aftermath. Recommendations for future research are also needed, as are recommendations on how best to implement these interventions in the context of a multi-disciplinary approach to addressing domestic violence, and how to tailor them to the needs of the community."
194," IVIG administration results in a 3% reduction in sepsis and a 4% reduction in one or more episodes of any serious infection but is not associated with reductions in other clinically important outcomes, including mortality. Prophylactic use of IVIG is not associated with any short-term serious side effects. The decision to use prophylactic IVIG will depend on the costs and the values assigned to the clinical outcomes. There is no justification for conducting additional RCTs to test the efficacy of previously studied IVIG preparations in reducing nosocomial infections in preterm and/or LBW infants."," Immunoglobulin is effective in reducing mortality in patients with pre-existing sepsis, but there is insufficient evidence to recommend its use as a substitute for IVIG in the treatment of pre-term infants with preterm infants who are at high risk of sepsIS. Further research is needed to determine the optimal dose and duration of IVIG therapy in these infants, as well as the optimal timing and timing of administration, and to compare the effectiveness of immunoglobulins with IVIG, IVIG and IVIG alone."
195," People with mild, moderate or severe dementia due to Alzheimer's disease treated for periods of 12, 24 or 52 weeks with donepezil experienced benefits in cognitive function, activities of daily living and behaviour. Study clinicians rated global clinical state more positively in treated patients, and measured less decline in measures of global disease severity. There is some evidence that use of donepezil is neither more nor less expensive compared with placebo when assessing total health care resource costs. Benefits on the 10 mg/day dose were marginally larger than on the 5 mg/day dose. Taking into consideration the better tolerability of the 5 mg/day donepezil compared with the 10 mg/day dose, together with the lower cost, the lower dose may be the better option. The debate on whether donepezil is effective continues despite the evidence of efficacy from the clinical studies because the treatment effects are small and are not always apparent in practice."," Cognitive performance tests are effective in reducing caregiver stress and improving caregiver competence in the short-term. Cognitive performance test results are similar to those of other cognitive performance tests. However, the results are based on a small number of small studies with a high risk of bias and a low risk of random errors. The quality of the evidence is low and the results do not indicate a significant difference in quality of life or caregiver satisfaction with cognitive performance test. Cognitive tests are also not significantly different from those of the control group. Positive findings of Cognitive Performance tests are similar in severity and severity of dementia, but cognitive tests are significantly more likely to be accurate than negative findings. Positive results of cognitive Performance tests should be interpreted with caution, as the results of these studies were based on only one study, and therefore the results cannot be extrapolated to all other cognitive tests. Cognitive Performance test results should be viewed with caution as the majority of the studies were conducted in Japan, where cognitive performance scores were similar to that of most of the other tests included in this review. The results of this review suggest that Cognitive Performance Tests may be useful in determining the level of cognitive performance testing in Alzheimer's Disease, but there is a need for further research."
196," There is no evidence from RCTs that supplementation with antioxidant vitamins (beta-carotene, vitamin C or vitamin E) prevents or slows the progression of age-related cataract. We do not recommend any further studies to examine the role of antioxidant vitamins beta-carotene, vitamin C and vitamin E in preventing or slowing the progression of age-related cataract. Costs and adverse effects should be weighed carefully with unproven benefits before recommending their intake above recommended daily allowances."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of beta carotene supplements in the treatment of cataract. There is a need for further research in this area, particularly in regards to the effects of alpha tocopherol supplements on the severity of the cataracts, as well as on the effectiveness of beta-carotene supplementation in reducing the incidence and progression of these conditions. The results of this review are based on a small number of small studies with a high risk of bias, and are subject to change in interpretation and interpretation."
197," Caring for people in acute day hospitals is as effective as inpatient care in treating acutely ill psychiatric patients. However, further data are still needed on the cost effectiveness of day hospitals."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the existence of an association between cost effectiveness and quality of life in psychopathology or social functioning. Further research is needed to identify the most effective way to integrate cost effectiveness, and to compare cost effectiveness with other forms of psychological therapies. It is also important to understand the mechanisms by which cost effectiveness works, and how cost effectiveness relates to quality and quantity of life, as well as to the cost effectiveness of the various approaches to cost effectiveness."
198," Available evidence suggests that interventions to increase use of booster seats among children age four to eight years are effective. Combining incentives (booster seat discount coupons or gift certificates) or distribution of free booster seats with education demonstrated marked beneficial outcomes for acquisition and use of booster seats for four to eight year olds. There is some evidence of beneficial effect of legislation on acquisition and use of booster seats but this was mainly from uncontrolled before-and-after studies, which did not meet the criteria for inclusion in the meta-analysis."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the effectiveness of electronic detectors in preventing injury. Further research is needed to determine the effectiveness and safety of electronic alarms in detecting injury, as well as their effectiveness in reducing injury rates, and to assess their effectiveness and cost-effectiveness in the prevention of injury, and their effectiveness as a deterrent to injury. It is also important to understand the mechanisms by which electronic detectors are used to detect injury, the types of detectors, and how they are used in addition to electronic detectors."
199," Inhaled antibiotic treatment probably improves lung function and reduces exacerbation rate, but a pooled estimate of the level of benefit is not possible. The best evidence is for inhaled tobramycin. More evidence, from trials of longer duration, is needed to determine whether this benefit is maintained and to determine the significance of development of antibiotic-resistant organisms."," Antibiotic prophylaxis is effective in improving lung function in patients with a P. aeruginosa infection. However, there is a need for further well-designed randomized controlled trials to evaluate the effects of prophylephrine injection on lung function and quality of life. Such trials are needed to determine the optimal dose, duration and duration of therapy, as well as to assess the effectiveness of the combination therapy in reducing the risk of pneumothorax."
200," Evidence suggests that risperidone and olanzapine are useful in reducing aggression and risperidone reduces psychosis, but both are associated with serious adverse cerebrovascular events and extrapyramidal symptoms. Despite the modest efficacy, the significant increase in adverse events confirms that neither risperidone nor olanzapine should be used routinely to treat dementia patients with aggression or psychosis unless there is severe distress or risk of physical harm to those living and working with the patient. Although insufficient data were available from the considered trials, a meta-analysis of seventeen placebo controlled trials of atypical neuroleptics for the treatment of behavioural symptoms in people with dementia conducted by the Food and Drug Administration suggested a significant increase in mortality (OR 1.7). A peer-reviewed meta-analysis (Schneider 2005) of 15 placebo controlled studies (nine unpublished) found similarly increased risk in mortality (OR=1.54, 95% CI 0.004 to 0.02, p=0.01) for the atypical neuroleptics."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of glucocorticoids in the treatment of agitation, agitation or psychosis in people with Alzheimer's disease. Further research is needed to establish the effectiveness of these drugs in treating agitation and agitation in these patients, as well as to assess the effects on other outcomes, such as psychological wellbeing and quality of life. Finally, long-term data are needed to determine the effectiveness and safety of glucosorticoid therapy in these conditions."
201," Behavioral interventions reduce self-reported unprotected anal sex among MSM. These results indicate that HIV prevention for this population can work and should be supported. Results of previous studies provide a benchmark for expectations in new studies. Meta-analysis can inform future design and implementation in terms of sample size, target populations, settings, goals for process measures, and intervention content. When effects differ by design variables, which are deliberately selected and planned, awareness of these characteristics may be beneficial to future designs. Researchers designing future small group and individual-level studies should keep in mind that to date, effects of the greatest magnitude have been observed in studies that used count outcomes and a shorter intervention span (up to 1 month). Among small group and individual-level studies, effects were also greatest when the comparison condition included minimal to no HIV prevention content. Nevertheless, statistically significant favorable effects were also seen when the comparison condition included standard or other HIV prevention content. Researchers choosing the latter option for new studies should plan for larger sample sizes based on the smaller expected net intervention effect noted above. When effects differ by implementation variables, which become evident as the study is conducted but are not usually selected or planned, caution may be advised so that future studies can reduce bias. Because intervention effects were somewhat stronger (though not statistically significantly so) in studies with a greater attrition in the comparison condition, differential retention may be a threat to validity. Extra effort should be given to retaining participants in comparison conditions. Among community-level interventions, intervention effects were strongest among studies with random assignment of groups or communities. Therefore the inclusion of studies where assignment of groups or communities was by convenience did not exaggerate the summary effect. The greater effectiveness of interventions including more than 25% non-gay identifying MSM suggests that when they can be reached, these men may be more responsive than gay-identified men to risk reduction efforts. Non-gay identified MSM may have had less exposure to previous prevention messages, so their initial exposure may have a greater impact. The greater effectiveness of interventions that include efforts to promote personal skills such as keeping condoms available and behavioral self-management indicates that such content merits strong consideration in development and delivery of new interventions for MSM. And the finding that interventions were most effective for majority white populations underscores the critical need for effective interventions for MSM of African and Latino descent. Further research measuring the incidence of HIV and other STDs is needed. Because most studies were conducted among mostly white men in the US and Europe, more evaluations of interventions are needed for African American and Hispanic MSM as well as MSM in the developing world. More research is also needed to further clarify which behavioral strategies (e.g., reducing unprotected anal sex, having oral sex instead of anal sex, reducing number of partners, avoiding serodiscordant partners, strategic positioning, or reducing anal sex even with condom use) are most effective in reducing transmission among MSM, the messages most effective in promoting these behaviors, and the methods and settings in which these messages can be most effectively delivered."," Sexual risk behaviours are significantly reduced with the use of social support and psychological support. Sexual support appears to be effective in reducing sexual risk behaviours, but its effectiveness is not clear from this review. Positive effects on sexual risk behaviors are likely to be sustained over time, but this is unlikely to translate into a reduction in sexual risk behaviour. Positive results from social support are unlikely to have an immediate impact on sexual risks behaviours. Positive findings from the review suggest that social support may be beneficial for reducing sexual risks behaviors, but further research is needed to assess the effects of this intervention."
202, Therapeutic aspiration in addition to metronidazole to hasten clinical or radiologic resolution of uncomplicated amoebic liver abscesses cannot be supported or refuted by the present evidence. The trials lack methodological rigour and adequate sample size to conclude on the presence of effectiveness of adjunctive image-guided aspiration plus metronidazole versus metronidazole alone. Further randomised trials are necessary.," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the existence of a beneficial effect of hydrocortisone in the treatment of abdominal tenderness. Further randomized controlled trials are needed to determine the effectiveness and safety of this treatment for tenderness in patients with abscessed abscess. Such trials should be of sufficient size and duration to provide a better understanding of the mechanisms by which this treatment works. They should also assess the effectiveness of hydocortisones in the management of tenderness, pain, fatigue, thirst, fatigue and fatigue."
203," The range of proven effective interventions for chronic pelvic pain remains limited and recommendations are based largely on single studies. Given the prevalence and healthcare costs associated with chronic pelvic pain in women, randomised controlled trials of other medical, surgical and psychological interventions are urgently required.Chronic pelvic pain is common in women in the reproductive and older age groups and it causes disability and distress that result in significant costs to health services. The pathogenesis of chronic pelvic pain is poorly understood. Often investigation by laparoscopy reveals no obvious cause for the pain. There are several possible explanations for chronic pelvic pain including undetected irritable bowel syndrome, and central sensitisation of the nervous system. A vascular hypothesis proposes that pain arises from dilated pelvic veins in which blood flow is markedly reduced. As the pathophysiology of chronic pelvic pain is not well understood, its treatment is often unsatisfactory and limited to symptom relief. Currently the main approaches to treatment include counselling or psychotherapy, attempts to provide reassurance using laparoscopy to exclude serious pathology, progestogen therapy such as with medroxyprogesterone acetate and surgery to interrupt nerve pathways."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of acupuncture for pain relief in women with pelvic pain. Further research is needed to determine the effectiveness of acupuncture in the treatment of pelvic pain, and to compare acupuncture with other treatments. Finally, there is a need for a meta-analysis of pain relief for women with chronic pain, as well as a comparison of acupuncture to other treatments for pelvic pain relief. Finally there is an urgent need for an assessment of the effects of acupuncture on quality of life, satisfaction with pain relief and satisfaction with satisfaction with analgesia."
204," There is insufficient evidence of efficacy of individual antioxidants, or antioxidants in general, in the treatment of people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. One study reported a mild positive effect but this was not supported in our analysis. If future trials of antioxidant medications are performed, careful attention should be given to sample size, outcome measures, and duration of the trials. The high tolerance and safety, and relatively low cost of vitamins C and E, explain the continuing use of these vitamins by physicians and people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. While there is no substantial clinical trial evidence to support their clinical use, there is no clear contraindication."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of antioxidant supplements in the treatment of ALS. Further randomized controlled trials are needed to determine whether antioxidant supplements are beneficial or harmful for ALS. Such trials should be undertaken in the context of a well-defined group of patients who are at high risk of relapse or death, and those who are unable to tolerate or tolerate antioxidant supplements. They should also evaluate the effects of antioxidant supplementation on survival and quality of life, and the impact of antioxidant supplementing supplements on quality and quantity."
205," The evidence from this updated review supports the use of KMC in LBW infants as an alternative to conventional neonatal care mainly in resource-limited settings. Further information is required concerning effectiveness and safety of early onset continuous KMC in unstabilized LBW infants, long term neurodevelopmental outcomes, and costs of care."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of kangaroo mother care for reducing mortality or morbidity in infants admitted to NICU. Further research is needed to establish the effectiveness and safety of this intervention in reducing mortality, morbidity and morbidity, and to assess the effectiveness of this approach in improving quality of life and reducing morbidity or mortality in neonates admitted to ICU. Recommendations for future research are also needed, as are recommendations to improve the quality and quantity of research."
206," Cyproterone acetate combined with estradiol results in a subjective improvement in hirsutism compared to placebo. Clinical differences in outcome between cyproterone acetate and other medical therapies were not demonstrated in the studies included in this review. This may be because of the small size of the studies, lack of standardized assessment and lack of objective determinants of improvement in hirsutism. The endocrinological effects of the different drug therapies reflect the mode of action. Larger carefully designed studies are needed to compare efficacy and safety profiles between drug therapies for hirsutism."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the effectiveness of testosterone supplementation for the treatment of hair loss or hair loss in menopausal women with HDH. Further research is needed to identify the optimal dosage and duration of testosterone therapy and to compare testosterone supplementation with other hormonal therapies, such as progestogens, progestogen, and estrogens, as well as to assess the effects of estrogen supplementation on hair loss and hair loss. Finally, to determine the optimal dose, duration and frequency of testosterone treatment, a meta-analysis is required to determine whether testosterone supplementation is beneficial or harmful."
207," MAO-B inhibitors (more specifically selegiline which contributes most of the data) do not appear to delay disease progression in terms of improved survival but may reduce later motor fluctuations. At present, we do not feel these drugs can be recommended for routine use in the treatment of early Parkinson's disease."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute levodopa for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. Further research is needed to identify the optimal dose, duration and timing of treatment, and the optimal dosage and duration of treatment. In addition, future trials should evaluate the efficacy and safety of this therapy in particular for motor impairments and impaired function, as well as the effectiveness of other treatments, such as prostaglandins, and for improving motor function in people with early PD."
208, There are few trials that have directly compared the antipyretic properties of paracetamol against placebo or physical methods. Data on adverse events are limited. Establishing standard outcomes will help comparisons between studies and better meta-analysis.," Antipyretic drugs are effective in reducing fever severity and duration of treatment, but there is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of these drugs in the treatment of feverish children with malaria. Further research is needed to assess the effects of these medications on fever severity, duration and severity, as well as the effectiveness of these treatments in reducing temperature severity and severity of fever severity in children with acute malaria and in children younger than two years of age."
209, A one to two weeks course of H. pylori eradication therapy is an effective treatment for H. pylori positive peptic ulcer disease.," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of antibiotics in the eradication of H. pylori infection. Further randomized controlled trials are needed to determine whether antibiotics are beneficial or harmful for H.pylori, and whether they should be used in combination with other antimicrobials, and to compare the effectiveness of antibiotic treatment with other antibiotics. Finally, there is a need for further research into the efficacy and safety of antibiotics for this condition. These trials should be of sufficient size and duration to compare antibiotic treatment to other antibiotics in this condition, and also to compare antibiotics with each other."
210," Although it appears that no one procedure produces greater benefit in terms of pain and physical function, there was insufficient evidence to be conclusive. Trapeziectomy has fewer complications than trapeziectomy with LRTI."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of silicone plugs in the treatment of pain relief in people with TMC OA. There is a need for further well-designed, well-conducted and reported randomised controlled trials to evaluate the effectiveness of silicone plug plugs in pain relief. Such trials should be of sufficient size to compare silicone plugs with silicone plugs. They should also evaluate the effects of silicone pads on pain relief and function, and on function."
211," We found no conclusive evidence to determine whether IDS between cycles of chemotherapy would improve or decrease the survival rates of women with advanced ovarian cancer, compared with conventional treatment of primary surgery followed by adjuvant chemotherapy. IDS appeared to yield benefit only in women whose primary surgery was not performed by gynaecologic oncologists or was less extensive. Data on QoL and adverse events were inconclusive."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the existence of a protective mechanism for reducing mortality and morbidity in patients with advanced disease who have been treated with cisplatin. Further research is needed to determine the effectiveness of this strategy in this population, and to compare it with other methods of treating advanced disease and to determine whether it has a protective effect on survival or morbidity. Finally, future research should focus on assessing the effectiveness and safety of these methods of treatment in advanced disease."
212," This updated review shows that custom-made foot orthoses are significantly more beneficial than sham orthoses for treating foot pain associated with pes cavus in a variety of clinical populations. We also show that some secondary biomechanical outcomes improve with custom-made foot orthoses and footwear, but not with botulinum toxin or off-the-shelf foot orthoses. There is an absence of evidence for any other type of intervention for the treatment or prevention of pes cavus."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of orthopaedic footwear in the treatment of foot pain. Further research is needed to identify the best footwear for this condition and to compare the effectiveness of various types of footwear in terms of comfort, comfort and comfort. Further studies are also needed to assess the effectiveness and durability of orthopedic footwear for pain relief in people with a chronic condition such as Achilles tendonitis and fibromyalgia, as well as to compare footwear with other types of shoes."
213, The four trials describing four different comparisons with a short follow up (1 to 3 cycles) were too small to either prove or discard the value of pulsatile GnRH treatment in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome.," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of progestogen in the treatment of premature luteal effusion. Further randomized controlled trials are needed to determine whether progestogens are beneficial or harmful. Such trials should be undertaken in the absence of a clear indication of the efficacy and safety of progesterone in this population. Further research is also needed to assess the effectiveness of hydestogen for premature Luteal Fusion, and to assess its safety and effectiveness."
214, Surgical treatment of carpal tunnel syndrome relieves symptoms significantly better than splinting. Further research is needed to discover whether this conclusion applies to people with mild symptoms and whether surgical treatment is better than steroid injection.," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of infrared photocoagulation for the treatment of chronic pain syndrome. Further research is needed to determine the effectiveness and safety of this method of treatment for pain relief in people with CTS. It is also important to understand the mechanisms by which these results are translated to other chronic pain disorders. Finally, there is a need for a meta-analysis of the effectiveness of infrared Photocoagulating for chronic pain relief of CTS, and to compare the effectiveness, safety and efficacy of infrared optics for other types of pain relief."
215," Sargramostim does not appear to be more effective than placebo for induction of clinical remission or clinical improvement in patients with active Crohn's disease. However, the GRADE analysis indicates that the overall quality of the evidence for the primary (clinical remission) and secondary outcomes (clinical response) was low indicating that further research is likely to have an impact on the effect estimates.", There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of ibuprofen in the treatment of patients with active Crohn's disease. Further randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm the effectiveness of ibiprofen as an adjunct to other treatments in the management of these patients. Such trials should be undertaken in the context of a well-defined set of patients who are in need of treatment. They should also include patients with severe disease who are at high risk of relapse and those who are unable to tolerate the drug.
216, Active chest compression-decompression in patients with cardiac arrest is not associated with clear benefit.," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of electrostimulation as a method of resuscitation in the resuscitation of patients with ROSC. Further research is needed to determine the best electrostimulating agent for resuscitation and to assess its effectiveness in patients with cardiac arrest, and to determine its role in other resuscitation procedures. It is also important to note that there is a need for further research in this area, as well as to evaluate the effects of electroimaging on survival and neurological function in patients who have been discharged from hospital."
217," There is inadequate evidence to recommend or refute the use of urinary hCG, as an ovulation trigger, in anovulatory women being treated with clomiphene citrate. We did not find trials evaluating the use of ovulation triggers in anovulatory women, being treated with other ovulation inducing agents."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the existence of a correlation between ovulation and pregnancy rates. Further research is needed to determine the effect of ovulation on pregnancy rates and fertility rates, and to compare ovulation with other methods of fertility management, such as oxytocin, progestogen, progesterone or progestogens, and other fertility management strategies. Finally, to determine whether ovulation rates are related to fertility management and fertility outcomes, and how to tailor ovulation to the needs of the population."
218," There is limited evidence on which to base clinical decisions regarding the prescription of custom-made foot orthoses for the treatment of foot pain. Currently, there is gold level evidence for painful pes cavus and silver level evidence for foot pain in JIA, rheumatoid arthritis, plantar fasciitis and hallux valgus."," Functional status and functional status of the foot are the most important determinants of pain relief for people with functional impairments in footwear. Functional status, functional status, quality of life and satisfaction with pain relief are also important indicators of improvement in functional status. Pain relief is also associated with improvement in function, pain intensity and function in the upper limb. Pain intensity is also significantly reduced in the lower limb, but there is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of functional status or functional status in footwear or footwear. Pain severity and function are also significantly improved in footwear and footwear compared to no treatment. Pain duration and severity are also improved in shoes and shoes compared with no treatment or no treatment compared to other types of footwear or shoes, but this is based on a very small number of studies with short term follow-up and a very high risk of bias in many of the studies."
219," Active management is associated with small reductions in the CS rate, but it is highly prescriptive and interventional. It is possible that some components of the active management package are more effective than others. Further work is required to determine the acceptability of active management to women in labour."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of epidural analgesia for caesarean section. Further research is needed to assess the effectiveness and safety of epidurals in this population, as well as to assess maternal satisfaction with labour management, maternal satisfaction and satisfaction with childbirth. Finally, there is a need for a meta-analysis of maternal satisfaction, satisfaction with labor management, and maternal and neonatal outcomes, and to compare epidural pain management with other methods of labour management."
220," The conclusions that can be drawn from this meta-analysis are limited due to the small number of studies. For none of the outcomes was a statistically significant difference seen between the different interventions. Current consensus is for the intrapartum administration of antibiotics when the diagnosis of intraamniotic infection is made; however, the results of this review neither support nor refute this although there was a trend towards improved neonatal outcomes when antibiotics were administered intrapartum. No recommendations can be made on the most appropriate antimicrobial regimen to choose to treat intraamniotic infection. [Note: The six citations in the awaiting classification section of the review may alter the conclusions of the review once assessed.]"," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of epinephrine injection for the treatment of endometritis. Further research is needed to identify the best way to administer epoxyclavuloplasty, the best route of administration, and the most effective way to treat endometriosis. Further trials are also needed to assess the effectiveness and safety of intrauterine injection for endometrial carcinoma, and to compare the effectiveness of epiphytic injection with other forms of epicyclic therapy."
221," Based on these four studies, two of which were subgroups of small numbers of eligible toddlers from larger studies, there is insufficient evidence of the analgesic effects of sweet tasting solutions or substances during acute painful procedures in children over one year of age. Further well-conducted RCTs are warranted in this population."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the effectiveness of relaxation exercises for relaxation exercises in pain relief or relaxation during relaxation exercises. Further research is needed to assess relaxation exercises and relaxation exercises during relaxation exercise, and to compare relaxation exercises with relaxation exercises, relaxation exercises or relaxation exercises alone. Finally, future research should evaluate relaxation exercises as an adjunct to relaxation exercises after relaxation exercises have been completed, and should include measures of relaxation relaxation and relaxation in relaxation exercises (including relaxation exercises)."
222," We conclude that there is no evidence of difference between rhCG or rhLH and uhCG in achieving final follicular maturation in IVF, with equivalent pregnancy rates and OHSS incidence. According to these findings uHCG is still the best choice for final oocyte maturation triggering in IVF and ICSI treatment cycles."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of progesterone for oocyte retrieval in vitro fertilisation. Further research is needed to identify the optimal dose and duration of progestogen therapy, the optimal dosage and timing of hydrazole, and the optimal timing of administration. Finally, there is a need for further investigation of the effectiveness of progosteroids for oocytes retrieved from vitro fertilization, and to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of these drugs in the management of oocytes."
223," Currently, there is insufficient evidence to recommend routine screening of asymptomatic or symptomatic pregnant women with TVU CL. Since there is a non-significant association between knowledge of TVU CL results and a lower incidence of PTB at less than 37 weeks in symptomatic women, we encourage further research. Future studies should look at specific populations separately (e.g., singleton versus twins; symptoms of PTL or no such symptoms), report on all pertinent maternal and perinatal outcomes, and include cost-effectiveness analyses. Most importantly, future studies should include a clear protocol for management of women based on TVU CL results, so that it can be easily evaluated and replicated."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of intrauterine excision in the treatment of SPCTB. Further research is needed to determine the effectiveness and safety of excision for SPCB in women with PTL. It is also important to understand the mechanisms by which excision may be performed, and how the excision process works, as well as the mechanism by which it may be done, and the timing and timing of recurrence and duration of the recurrence."
224," The most likely effective treatment to slow myopia progression thus far is anti-muscarinic topical medication. However, side effects of these medications include light sensitivity and near blur. Also, they are not yet commercially available, so their use is limited and not practical. Further information is required for other methods of myopia control, such as the use of corneal reshaping contact lenses or bifocal soft contact lenses (BSCLs) with a distance center are promising, but currently no published randomized clinical trials exist."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of photocoagulation in myopia. Further research is needed to identify the optimal photocoaggulation technique, the best way to achieve this, and the most effective way to minimise the risk of bias in this review. Finally, there is a need for further research into the effectiveness and safety of photocagulation for myopia, as well as to compare the effectiveness of these approaches to other methods of optical manipulation, such as binocular tomography."
225," Generally, fluoroquinolones performed well in treating typhoid, and maybe superior to alternatives in some settings. However, we were unable to draw firm general conclusions on comparative contemporary effectiveness given that resistance changes over time, and many studies were small. Policy makers and clinicians need to consider local resistance patterns in choosing a fluoroquinolone or alternative. There is some evidence that the newest fluoroquinolone, gatifloxacin, remains effective in some regions where resistance to older fluoroquinolones has developed. However, the different fluoroquinolones have not been compared directly in trials in these settings."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of azathioprine as a substitute for ampicillin in the treatment of people with malaria. Further research is needed to determine the optimal dose and duration of amicillin, the optimal duration of antibiotic therapy, and the optimal dosage and timing of therapy. In addition, future trials should evaluate the effectiveness and safety of these drugs, as well as the duration of treatment, and to compare these drugs with each other in terms of efficacy, safety and efficacy."
226," The evidence suggests that a discharge plan tailored to the individual patient probably brings about reductions in hospital length of stay and readmission rates for older people admitted to hospital with a medical condition. The impact of discharge planning on mortality, health outcomes and cost remains uncertain."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the existence of a mechanism by which healthcare professionals can improve the quality of healthcare services provided to patients in hospital. Further research is needed to establish the effectiveness of this mechanism, and to assess its effectiveness in terms of reducing mortality and health service utilization, improving quality of life and reducing costs of care, and improving access to care. It is also important to understand the mechanisms by which this can be achieved, as well as how it relates to costs and availability of services."
227, Increasing the pH of lidocaine decreased pain on injection and augmented patient comfort and satisfaction.," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of bicarbonate as an adjunct to local anaesthetic therapy for the treatment of pain relief in patients undergoing surgery. Further research is needed to determine the optimal dose and duration of bacarbonate for pain relief, and to assess the effectiveness of other types of anaesthesia in pain relief. Finally, there is a need for a well-designed, well-executed randomised controlled trial to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of BOCs in this population."
228," Prophylactic systemic antibiotics in neonates with a central venous catheter reduces the rate of proven or suspected septicaemia. However, this may not be clinically important in the face of no significant difference in overall mortality and the lack of data on long-term neurodevelopmental outcome. Furthermore, there is a lack of data pertaining to the potentially significant disadvantages of this approach such as the selection of resistant organisms. The routine use of prophylactic antibiotics in infants with central venous catheters in neonatal units cannot currently be recommended."," There is no evidence to support or refute the use of prophylactic antibiotics in the treatment of CONS bacteraemia. However, there is a need for further research to evaluate the effectiveness of antibiotic therapy in the management of these infections. Further research is needed to identify the optimal antibiotic regimen and the optimal timing and duration of antibiotic administration. Finally, it is important to understand the mechanisms by which antibiotic therapy works, and to compare antibiotic therapy with other methods of purifying bacteria."
229," Updated evidence is of low quality, and potential differences between early and late tracheostomy need to be better investigated by means of randomized controlled trials. At present there is no specific information about any subgroup or individual characteristics potentially associated with better outcomes with either early or late tracheostomy."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of mechanical ventilation in the treatment of pneumonia. Further research is needed to determine the best method of ventilation in patients with pneumonia, and to compare mechanical ventilation with other methods of ventilation, such as mechanical ventilation, or mechanical ventilation alone or in combination with mechanical ventilation. Finally, there is a need for further research into the effectiveness and safety of electrostimulation therapy in this population of patients who are at high risk of pneumonia, or who are in need of intensive care."
230, The conclusion is that the choice of drug must be made based on consideration of drug-specific side effect properties.," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of antidepressants for the treatment of depression in people with dysthymia. Further research is needed to identify the best antidepressant for this condition, and to compare the efficacy of antidepressants with other antidepressants, as well as to assess the effectiveness of antidepressants in the management of depressive disorders in these patients. Finally, to determine the optimal antidepressant dose and duration of antidepressant therapy, a meta-analysis of the efficacy and safety of antidepressants is warranted."
231," The results suggest that iodised salt is an effective means of improving iodine status. No conclusions can be made about improvements in other, more patient-oriented outcomes, such as physical and mental development in children and mortality. None of the studies specifically investigated development of iodine-induced hyperthyroidism, which can be easily overlooked if just assessed on the basis of symptoms. High quality controlled studies investigating relevant long term outcome measures are needed to address questions of dosage and best means of iodine supplementation in different population groups and settings."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the effectiveness of iodine supplementation for iodine deficiency in thyroid gland size, thyroid volume, thyroid size or thyroid hormone sensitivity. Further research is needed to determine whether iodine supplementation is beneficial or harmful for thyroid gland function, thyroid hormones, thyroid hormone levels and thyroid hormones in thyroid glands, thyroid tone and thyroid volume. Finally, to determine the effectiveness and safety of iodine supplements for thyroid hormone deficiency, a meta-analysis of thyroid hormone concentrations is warranted."
232," We found only low quality evidence on the use of chemotherapy in malignant germ cell tumours of the ovaries. Therefore we are unable to reach definite conclusions about the relative benefits and harms of chemotherapy use in this disease regardless of disease stage. Due to the benefit of chemotherapy in germ cell cancer of the testis, a trial of chemotherapy versus best supportive care is unlikely to be feasible. Despite this, good quality randomised studies are warranted in this disease to define the role of chemotherapy (type of chemotherapy, duration of treatment, benefit, short and long term toxicities). Given the rarity of this disease, we feel a trans-global approach would be essential in order to perform such trials."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of antibiotics in the treatment of EB. Further randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm the effectiveness of antibiotic therapy in EB, and to compare the effectiveness and safety of antibiotic treatment in EB. Such trials should be undertaken in the context of a well-defined group of patients who are at high risk of EB and those who are unable to tolerate antibiotic treatment or who do not wish to use it."
233," There is some evidence from five RCTs that behavioural interventions may be effective for dysmenorrhoea. However results should be viewed with caution as they varied greatly between trials due to inconsistency in the reporting of data, small trial size, poor methodological quality and age of the trials."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the effectiveness of acupuncture for EM. Further research is needed to establish the effectiveness and safety of acupuncture in EM. It is also important to understand the mechanisms by which acupuncture works for EM, as well as the types of acupuncture used and how they are used in the treatment of EM. In addition, there is a need for a well-designed, well-conducted and reported randomised controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of acupuncture on EM."
234," In addition to these randomized controlled trials, a body of lower quality evidence does exist relevant to two other important interventions; the use of supplemental enteral nutrition (Morin 1980; Belli 1988; Israel 1995) and the judicious use of surgical interventions in pre-pubertal children with refractory disease (Alperstein 1985; Lipson 1990; McLain 1990). Newer treatments, such as infliximab, are now becoming more widely used and may offer advantages in promoting growth. These effects are as yet unstudied. This review highlights the need for large, multi centre studies of the different treatment options in paediatric Crohn's disease and the importance of standardised measurements of growth, such as height velocity standard deviation scores and height standard deviation scores as outcome measures."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of glucocorticoids in the treatment of mild leukopenia. Further research is needed to determine the optimal dose, duration and timing, and duration of glucoconorticoid therapy in this condition. Finally, there is a need for a meta-analysis of the effectiveness of glucosorticosteroids in reducing the risk of adverse events, and to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of glucocoorticoidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in this population."
235," In elective liver resection, hepatic vascular occlusion cannot be recommended over portal triad clamping. Intermittent portal triad clamping seems to be better than continuous portal triad clamping at least in patients with chronic liver disease. There is no evidence to support selective inflow occlusion over portal triad clamping. The optimal method of intermittent portal triad clamping is not clear. There is no evidence for any difference between the ischaemic preconditioning followed by vascular occlusion and intermittent vascular occlusion for liver resection in patients with non-cirrhotic livers. Further randomised trials of low risk of bias are needed to determine the optimal technique of vascular occlusion."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of selective clamping as a means of reducing blood loss during liver transection. Further research is needed to determine the best method of clamping, the best way to minimise blood loss, and the best technique for clamping. Finally, there is a need for an assessment of the effectiveness of selective grafting as an alternative to open clamping in terms of reduced blood loss and mortality, and to compare the effectiveness and safety of this approach to open grafting."
236," Although antibiotic treatment is effective for the cure of urinary tract infections, there are insufficient data to recommend any specific drug regimen for treatment of symptomatic urinary tract infections during pregnancy. All the antibiotics studied were shown to be very effective in decreasing the incidence of the different outcomes. Complications were very rare. All included trials had very small sample sizes to reliably detect important differences between treatments. Future studies should evaluate the most promising antibiotics, in terms of class, timing, dose, acceptability, maternal and neonatal outcomes and costs."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of antibiotic prophylaxis in the treatment of antibiotic-resistant pyelonephritis. Further randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm the effectiveness of prophylephrine in reducing antibiotic usage in this condition. Such trials should be undertaken in the context of a large number of cases of antibiotic resistance, and should be of high methodological quality. They should also evaluate the effects of antibiotics on the incidence of adverse events, such as diarrhoea, and the duration of antibiotic treatment."
237, Metered-dose inhalers with spacer produced outcomes that were at least equivalent to nebuliser delivery. Spacers may have some advantages compared to nebulisers for children with acute asthma.," Salbutamol is effective in reducing the incidence of pulmonary embolisms in patients with acute asthma. It is also associated with a reduction in the risk of pneumothorax, a decreased risk of respiratory distress syndrome, and an increased risk of hypoxaemia. However, these results are based on only a small number of patients and are not representative of the whole range of treatments available in this review. Further research is needed to determine the optimal dose and duration of salbutamnol and the optimal dosage and timing of salmeterol and its use in these patients."
238, A comparison of the effects of human and animal insulin as well as of the adverse reaction profile did not show clinically relevant differences. Many patient-oriented outcomes like health-related quality of life or diabetes complications and mortality were never investigated in high-quality randomised clinical trials. The story of the introduction of human insulin might be repeated by contemporary launching campaigns to introduce pharmaceutical and technological innovations that are not backed up by sufficient proof of their advantages and safety.," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of human insulin in the treatment of hypoglycaemia. Further research is needed to identify the optimal insulin dose and duration, and to evaluate the effectiveness of human insulins in this population. Finally, there is a need for further research into the efficacy and safety of animal insulin in reducing blood glucose levels in humans and in developing countries, and also to compare human insulin with animal insulin. Finally there is an urgent need for research into how human insulin should be used in developing nations, as well as in developing regions of Europe and Asia."
239," Risperidone can be beneficial in some features of autism. However there are limited data available from studies with small sample sizes. In addition, there lacks a single standardised outcome measure allowing adequate comparison of studies, and long-term followup is also lacking. Further research is necessary to determine the efficacy pf risperidone in clinical practice."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the existence of an antipsychotic drug for the treatment of autism spectrum disorders. Further randomized controlled trials are needed to determine the efficacy and safety of this drug for autism spectrum disorder. Such trials are also needed to evaluate the effectiveness of other antidepressant drugs, such as ibuprofen, naproxen, and serotonin reuptake inhibitors, as well as to compare these drugs with each other and to compare them to each other in terms of efficacy and effectiveness."
240, Further research is needed on the comparison of different types of low vision aids. It will be also necessary to delineate patient's characteristics that predict performance with costly electronic devices as well as their sustained use in the long term compared to simpler and cheaper optical devices.," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of any particular type of optical device for reading speed or accuracy. Further research is needed to identify the most effective type and wavelength of optical devices and to compare them to other types of visual aids. Finally, there is a need for further research into the effectiveness of various types and wavelengths of optical technology for reading accuracy and accuracy, as well as to compare the effectiveness and reliability of these technologies to other forms of optical therapy."
241," While brief counselling interventions have been identified as successful ifor adults when delivered by physicians, this cannot be extrapolated to adults as parents in child health settings. However, there is limited support for more intensive counselling interventions for parents in such contexts. There is no clear evidence of differences between the respiratory, non-respiratory ill child, well child and peripartum settings as contexts for reduction of children's ETS exposure."," There is insufficient evidence to recommend or refute the use of any particular type of intervention for the prevention of ETS in mothers or children. Further research is needed to identify the most effective intervention and the best way to tailor it to the needs of the mother or child, and to compare the effectiveness of different types of intervention in different populations and settings. Finally, future research should evaluate the effectiveness and safety of interventions to reduce ETS exposure in mothers and children, as well as identify the types of interventions that are most effective."
242," Oral protein calorie supplements are widely used to improve the nutritional status of children with a number of chronic diseases. We identified a small number of studies assessing these products in children with cystic fibrosis, but were unable to draw any conclusions based on the limited data extracted. We recommend a series of large, randomised controlled trials be undertaken investigating the use of these products in children with different chronic diseases. Until further data are available, we suggest these products are used with caution."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of nutritional supplements in the management of overweight or obesity. Further randomized controlled trials are needed to determine the effects of nutritional supplement supplementation on body mass index centile strength and metabolic fitness in overweight or obese patients with moderate to severe obesity, and to compare nutritional supplements with placebo or no supplementation in obese patients. Such trials are also needed to assess the effects on metabolic fitness, metabolic fitness and physical fitness, as well as metabolic fitness."
243, Long acting inhaled beta-agonists have advantages across a wide range of physiological and clinical outcomes for regular treatment.," Salmeterol is effective in reducing the number of patients admitted to hospital and improving lung function in the short-term, but its use is associated with a higher risk of death and a decreased risk of respiratory distress syndrome. Its efficacy is similar to that of salmeterol, but with a lower risk of pneumonia and an increased risk of bronchodilator toxicity. Its use is not associated with an increase in the risk of pulmonary embolisms or death, or a decreased rate of respiratory failure. Its safety profile is comparable to that that of other inhaled corticosteroids, but it is not clear whether its efficacy is related to its long-term safety profile."
244," Antibiotics covering aerobic and aerobic bacteria should be delivered orally and intravenously prior to colorectal surgery. Antibiotics delivered within this framework will reduce the risk of postoperative SWI by at least 75%. Further research is required to establish the optimal timing and duration of dosing, and frequency of longer-term adverse effects such as Clostridium difficile pseudomembranous colitis."," Antibiotic prophylaxis is effective in reducing the incidence of bacterial contamination in the first two weeks after surgery. However, there is a need for further research to evaluate the effectiveness of antibiotic prothylaxis in this population, and to compare the effectiveness and safety of different antibiotic regimens. Finally, to determine the optimal antibiotic regimen, the optimal dose and duration of antibiotic treatment, and the optimal dosage and timing of antibiotic therapy, we recommend that all patients receive an appropriate amount of antibiotics to avoid bacterial contamination."
245," There is no certain study regarding appropriate use, dose and length of therapy for acute GvHD. Further studies are needed to define the appropriate use of steroids and whether other agents are appropriate as frontline therapy."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of prophylactic antibiotics in the treatment of CMV infections. Further randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm the effectiveness of antibiotics in treating CMV infection, and to compare the effectiveness and safety of antibiotics with no treatment or no treatment. Such trials are also needed to assess the effectiveness, safety and efficacy of antibiotics. Such studies should also assess the efficacy and effectiveness of antibiotic therapy in the management of MRV infections, as well as the quality of the evidence."
246," Available evidence nevertheless suggests that compared with standard care or no intervention, behavioral interventions are effective in reducing HIV and the incidence of STIs amongst female sex workers (FSWs). Given the benefits of social cognitive theory and the promotion of condom use in reducing HIV/STI and the public health need to control transmission amongst FSWs, there is a clear finding in favour of behavioral interventions. However, it should be recognized that there is a lack of information about most other outcomes and target populations, and that all of the trials were conducted in low- and middle-income countries."," The results of this review support the use of male condoms in reducing STI prevalence. However, there is insufficient evidence to recommend male condoms as a substitute for female condoms in the prevention of STI. Further research is needed to assess the effectiveness of male condom use in preventing STI incidence and prevalence, and to compare male condoms with female condoms, as well as to compare the efficacy of male and female condoms compared to female condoms. Recommendations for male condoms should also be made for women and their partners, and for women with STI risk factors."
247," This review demonstrated that there is insufficient evidence to draw definitive conclusions regarding the impact of educational or behavioural interventions on TTR in AF patients receiving OAT. Thus, more trials are needed to examine the impact of interventions on anticoagulation control in AF patients and the mechanisms by which they are successful. It is also important to explore the psychological implications for patients suffering from this long-term chronic condition."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of self-management tools in the management of OAT. Further research is needed to identify the most effective tools to improve self management tools, and to compare them with other types of management tools. Finally, there is a need for further research into the effectiveness of self management technologies in reducing OAT and improving quality of life and cost-effectiveness in patients with a history of major bleeding and a focus on improving the quality of the evidence base."
248," Although numerous studies have been undertaken, there is a noticeable inconsistency of the findings of the available studies and this is confounded by serious methodological issues within the included studies. The body of evidence in this review does not support the hypothesis that multi-component community wide interventions effectively increase population levels of physical activity. There is a clear need for well-designed intervention studies and such studies should focus on the quality of the measurement of physical activity, the frequency of measurement and the allocation to intervention and control communities."," Physical activity programmes are effective in lowering blood pressure and reducing triglycerides in physical activity programmes. Physical activity programs are associated with a reduction in triglycerides and LDL-cholesterol levels. Physical activities programmes are also associated with an increase in triglyceride levels and triglycerides levels. Exercise programmes may be associated with reduced triglycerides, but there is no evidence of an effect on triglycerides or cholesterol levels in physical activities programmes. Exercise programs may reduce triglycerides but there are insufficient data to assess the effects of exercise programmes on blood pressure, cholesterol levels or triglycerides. Further research is needed to identify the best type of exercise programme and to compare the effectiveness of exercise programs."
249," Benefits of screening include a modest reduction in colorectal cancer mortality, a possible reduction in cancer incidence through the detection and removal of colorectal adenomas, and potentially, the less invasive surgery that earlier treatment of colorectal cancers may involve.Harmful effects of screening include the psycho-social consequences of receiving a false-positive result, the potentially significant complications of colonoscopy or a false-negative result, the possibility of overdiagnosis (leading to unnecessary investigations or treatment) and the complications associated with treatment."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the existence of a protective effect of immunosuppressive agents on mortality from CRC. Further research is needed to determine the effectiveness of these agents in the treatment of CRC. It is also important to understand the mechanisms by which these agents are used in the management of CRC, and how they are applied to individuals with a high risk of death from CRC, as well as to assess the effects of these treatments on quality of life and mortality."
250," For participants with partial onset seizures oxcarbazepine is significantly less likely to be withdrawn, but current data do not allow a statement as to whether oxcarbazepine is equivalent, superior or inferior to phenytoin in terms of seizure control. However, the design of the studies may have biased seizure outcomes and misclassification of epilepsy type may have biased withdrawal rates."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of ipratropium for the treatment of premature discontinuation due to adverse events. Further randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm the effectiveness of ipatropium in treating premature discontinuations of epinephrine and phenytoin, as well as to assess its efficacy in the management of these adverse events, and to compare its efficacy with other treatments. Finally, a randomized controlled trial is needed to evaluate the efficacy of ipotropium as an adjuvant therapy for premature discontination due to poor quality of the evidence."
251," There appears to be little basis for offering CSE over epidurals in labour, with no difference in overall maternal satisfaction despite a slightly faster onset with CSE and conversely less pruritus with low-dose epidurals. There was no difference in ability to mobilise, maternal hypotension, rate of caesarean birth or neonatal outcome. However, the significantly higher incidence of urinary retention, rescue interventions and instrumental deliveries with traditional techniques would favour the use of low-dose epidurals. It is not possible to draw any meaningful conclusions regarding rare complications such as nerve injury and meningitis."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of bupivacaine as a substitute for oxytocin for epidural analgesia, or to support its use as an alternative to epidural anaesthesia. Further research is needed to determine the optimal dose and duration of buppivacain, the optimal dosage and timing of epidural administration, and the most effective analgesia for the treatment of pain relief in women in labor and childbirth, and to assess the effectiveness of other analgesia."
252," NO donors are superior to placebo or no treatment, but inferior to prostaglandins for first-trimester cervical ripening, and associated with more side effects."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the effectiveness of cervical dilatation as a treatment for cervical ripening. Further research is needed to assess the effectiveness and safety of cervical dilation as an alternative to cervical dilation as an adjuvant treatment to cervical excision, and to compare cervical dilatal excision with cervical dilating as a non-ideal treatment. Finally, there is a need for a well-designed, well-conducted and reported randomised controlled trial comparing cervical dilate with cervical ripener as a standard treatment. Such a trial is warranted in order to determine the best method of dilating cervical dilates."
253," Repetitive task training resulted in modest improvement in lower limb function, but not upper limb function. Training may be sufficient to impact on daily living function. However, there is no evidence that improvements are sustained once training has ended. The review potentially investigates task specificity rather more than repetition. Further research should focus on the type and amount of training, and how to maintain functional gain."," The results of this review suggest that there is no evidence to support or refute the use of manual walking aids for enhancing walking speed or endurance in disabled persons. However, there is a need for further research into the effectiveness of manual walk aids for disabled persons with impaired limb function and functional independence after discharge from hospital. Further research is needed to assess the effectiveness and durability of manual-assisted walking aids, and to compare manual walking aid with manual-based walking aids."
254," There is insufficient evidence either for or against the use of stabilisation splint therapy for the treatment of temporomandibular pain dysfunction syndrome. This review suggests the need for further, well conducted RCTs that pay attention to method of allocation, outcome assessment, large sample size, and enough duration of follow up. A standardisation of the outcomes of the treatment of PDS should be established in the RCTs."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the effectiveness of acupuncture for pain relief in adults with TMD. Further research is needed to determine the effectiveness and safety of acupuncture, and to compare acupuncture with other treatments. Finally, there is a need for a meta-analysis of the efficacy of acupuncture in the treatment of TMD, and a comparison of acupuncture to other treatments in adults. Finally there is an issue of the quality of the evidence, as well as the reliability of the results, and the usefulness of these findings."
255," The results of this systematic review indicate that virtual reality endoscopy training can be used to effectively supplement early conventional endoscopy training (apprenticeship model) in diagnostic oesophagogastroduodenoscopy, colonoscopy and/or sigmoidoscopy for health professions trainees with limited or no prior endoscopic experience. However, there remains insufficient evidence to advise for or against the use of virtual reality simulation-based training as a replacement for early conventional endoscopy training (apprenticeship model) for health professions trainees with limited or no prior endoscopic experience. There is a great need for the development of a reliable and valid measure of endoscopic performance prior to the completion of further randomised clinical trials with high methodological quality."," Technical skill training is a useful tool in the management of pain and discomfort associated with endoscopic insertion and negotiation of rectosigmoid junction. However, it is not clear whether technical skill training has a beneficial effect on pain or discomfort. Practitioners should be aware that there is a need for further research into technical skills training in this area. Further research is needed to identify the most effective technical training and the most appropriate tool to employ in this role."
256," The findings of this review suggest that oral naltrexone did not perform better than treatment with placebo or no pharmacological agent with respect to the number of participants re-incarcerated during the study period. If oral naltrexone is compared with other pharmacological treatments such as benzodiazepine and buprenorphine, no statistically significant difference was found. The percentage of people retained in treatment in the included studies is however low (28%). The conclusion of this review is that the studies conducted have not allowed an adequate evaluation of oral naltrexone treatment in the field of opioid dependence. Consequently, maintenance therapy with naltrexone cannot yet be considered a treatment which has been scientifically proved to be superior to other kinds of treatment."," There is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of naltrexone for the treatment of relapse or relapse of heroin dependence. Further research is needed to assess the efficacy and safety of Naltrexones for relapse and relapse, and to compare the effectiveness of NALTrexone with other antidepressants, and also to assess its efficacy in relapse. Finally, future research should evaluate the effectiveness and safety, and the impact on relapse severity and relapse severity, as well as its effectiveness in reducing relapse severity."
257, There is no evidence to support the use of vaginal chlorhexidine during labour in preventing maternal and neonatal infections. There is a need for a well-designed randomized controlled trial using appropriate concentration and volume of vaginal chlorhexidine irrigation solution and with adequate sample size.," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of pressure catheters for peripartal infection. Further research is needed to identify the best pressure catheter for this purpose, and to compare the effectiveness and safety of different methods of pressure-catheter administration. Finally, there is a need for a well-designed randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effectiveness of various methods of catheter drainage in the treatment of this condition. It is also important to note that the data are based on a small number of cases, and therefore the conclusions of this review are not necessarily definitive."
258," The addition of corticosteroids reduces the incidences of acute GvHD grade I to IV and II to IV. This reduction, however, did not show any effect on overall survival and disease-free survival. Further randomised controlled studies are needed to evaluate if the timing of steroid administration has a significant influence on the outcome; data on quality of life should be assessed systematically."," There is insufficient evidence to recommend prophylactic immunoglobulin for the treatment of GVHD. Further research is needed to identify the best immunoglubulin regimen and to assess its effectiveness in the treatment and prevention of GGVHD. It is also important to note that there is a need for further research into the effectiveness of immunoglabulin in the management of these diseases. Finally, there is an urgent need for a large scale, multi-centre randomized controlled trial comparing the effectiveness and safety of immunosuppressive therapy to standard therapy. Such trials should include a large number of patients and involve a number of participants."
259," There is insufficient evidence to evaluate the effectiveness of sustained-release naltrexone for treatment of opioid dependence.For naltrexone injections, administration site-related adverse effects appear to be frequent, but of moderate intensity and time limited. For a harm-benefit evaluation of naltrexone implants, more data on side effects and adverse events are needed."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of Naltrexone in the treatment of opioid addicts. Further research is needed to establish the effectiveness and safety of this drug. It is also important to understand the mechanisms by which this drug works, and how it relates to other psychosocial interventions, and to assess the effectiveness of other interventions, such as nicotine replacement therapy, antidepressants, and other psychological therapies, as well as to determine the efficacy of these interventions in reducing opioid consumption."
260," The use of ddI and, to a lesser extent, ddC delayed both HIV disease progression and death, at least when added to AZT."," There is no evidence to support or refute the use of zidovudine as a monotherapy for the treatment of disease progression or death in patients with advanced HIV disease. However, zidivudine appears to be a viable option for those patients who are at high risk of death from this treatment. Further research is needed to determine the optimal dose and duration of ziravudine, the optimal dosage and timing, and the best way to administer it. It is also important to note that the data in this review are based on a small number of patients, and therefore the conclusions of this review may not necessarily apply to all patients, or to those patients with severe disease."
261," The retinoids studied are not effective in causing regression of CIN3 but may have some effect on CIN2. The data on CIN1 are inadequate. Retinoids are not effective in preventing progression of CIN of any grade. At the doses given for the duration of treatment studied, the retinoids were reasonably well tolerated."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of isotretinoin for the treatment of cervical carcinoma. Further research is needed to identify the optimal isotretoin concentration, duration of therapy, and the optimal dose. Finally, there is a need for a meta-analysis of long-term outcomes, including quality of life, and to evaluate the effects on other aspects of life and health-related quality-of-life, including the occurrence of adverse events."
262," Although strong evidence supports the use of magnesium sulphate for prevention and treatment of eclampsia, trials comparing alternative treatment regimens are too small for reliable conclusions."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of magnesium supplementation in the treatment of eclampsia. Further research is needed to identify the optimal dose, duration and timing of supplementation, and to compare magnesium supplementation with other supplements, especially magnesium supplements, in the management of ECLampsia in women with pre-existing hypertension or pre-menopausal conditions. Finally, long-term data are needed to determine the optimal dosage and duration of magnesium supplements and to determine whether magnesium supplementation is beneficial or harmful for the prevention and management of recurrent ECLAMPIA."
263, Doses of FP in the range 100-1000 mcg/day are effective. In most patients with mild-moderate asthma improvements with low dose FP are only a little less than those associated with high doses when compared with placebo. High dose FP appears to have worthwhile oral-corticosteroid reducing properties. FP use is accompanied by an increased likelihood of oropharyngeal side effects.," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of glucocorticoids in the treatment of acute bronchoconstriction in patients with asthma. Further randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm the effectiveness of these drugs in reducing the incidence of asthma-related adverse events, and to determine the optimal dose and duration of glucocoorticoid therapy in these patients. Finally, long-term data are required to assess the effectiveness and safety of glucosorticosteroids in this patient population, as well as to assess their effectiveness in the management of asthma."
264," Postoperative platinum based chemotherapy is associated with a small benefit in progression-free survival and overall survival irrespective of radiotherapy treatment. It reduces the risk of developing a metastasis, could be an alternative to radiotherapy and has added value when used with radiotherapy."," There is no evidence to support or refute the use of prophylactic chemoprophylactic chemotherapy in the treatment of cancer-specific survival. However, there is a need for further research in this area. The results of this review are based on a small number of patients, all of whom are undergoing chemotherapy for cancer-related survival. Further research is needed to determine the optimal dose and duration of chemotherapy and to assess the optimal dosage and timing of chemotherapy. Finally, to evaluate the effectiveness of pro-phylaxis in cancer-associated survival, a meta-analysis is needed."
265," Information on all comparisons are of limited quality, are incomplete and problematic to apply clinically. Aripiprazole is an antipsychotic drug with a variant but not absent adverse effect profile. Long-term data are sparse and there is considerable scope for another update of this review as new data emerges from the many Chinese studies as well as from ongoing larger, independent pragmatic trials."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of olanzapine for the treatment of PAN. Further research is needed to determine its role in the management of weight gain in people with schizophrenia. It is also important to note that there is a number needed to treat patients with schizophrenia to prevent them from relapse, and to evaluate its efficacy in the long term. Finally, there is an urgent need for further research into the efficacy and safety of this drug in patients with severe schizophrenia."
266," Telephone consultation appears to reduce the number of surgery contacts and out-of-hours visits by general practitioners. However, questions remain about its affect on service use and further rigorous evaluation is needed with emphasis on service use, safety, cost and patient satisfaction."," Telephone billings are effective in reducing telephone billings and reducing the number of calls made by telephone callers. However, there is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of billings as a substitute for phone calls in terms of reducing phone billings or reducing calls missed by callers or others. Further research is needed to assess the effectiveness of billing and phone calls as alternatives to phone calls, and to compare billings with other forms of telephone bills and telephone calls."
267," This review provides no clear evidence for the treatment of cirrhotic patients with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. In practice, third generation cephalosporins have already been established as the standard treatment of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, and it is clear, that empirical antibiotic therapy should be provided in any case. However, until large, well-conducted trials provide more information, practice will remain based on impression, not evidence."," Prophylactic antibiotic therapy with ciprofloxacin is associated with a significant reduction in mortality, but a significant increase in the incidence of adverse events, including diarrhoea, in patients with uncomplicated bacterial peritonitis who are receiving antibiotic therapy. The risk-benefit ratio of antibiotic therapy is low, but the number of cases of adverse effects is very low, and there is a need for further research. It is unlikely that antibiotic therapy will result in any significant difference in mortality or morbidity in patients receiving antibiotic treatment."
268," In view of methodological deficiencies and limited number of individual studies, we have found no reliable evidence to support the routine use of vitamins in patients with epilepsy. Further trials are needed, especially to assess the utility of vitamin D supplementation to prevent osteomalacia and the role of vitamin E on seizures and thiamine in improving cognitive functions."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of phenytoin for the treatment of gingival over-growth. There is a need for further well-designed, well-conducted and reported randomised controlled trials to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of this treatment. Such trials should be of sufficient size to detect clinically important differences in efficacy and safety between the two treatments. They should also assess the effectiveness of other treatments, such as calcium channel blockers, magnesium sulphate and calcium channel blocker blockers, as well as the effects of these treatments on bone mineral content and bone mineral density."
269," We detected no difference in the effect on parasites and clinical illness for intrarectal quinine, but most trials were small. Pain may be less with intrarectal proprietary, buffered quinine preparations (made less acidic by adjustment of the pH to 4.5). Further larger trials in patients with severe malaria and in adults are required before the intrarectal route can be recommended."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of intravenous immunoglobulins in the treatment of malaria. Further research is needed to establish the effectiveness of this therapy in reducing mortality and morbidity in patients with severe malaria, and to compare the effectiveness and safety of this treatment with other treatments. Finally, to determine the optimal dose and duration of administration, the optimal dosage and timing of administration and the best way to administer it, and the most effective way to deliver it to patients in severe malaria."
270," As a result of the few available studies, no convincing conclusions can be formulated about the effectiveness of workplace interventions on work-related outcomes and health outcomes regardless of the type of work disability. The pooled data for the musculoskeletal disorders subgroup indicated that workplace interventions are effective in the reduction of sickness absence, but they are not effective in improving health outcomes. The evidence from the subgroup analysis on musculoskeletal disorders was rated as moderate-quality evidence. Unfortunately, conclusions cannot be drawn on the effectiveness of these interventions for mental health problems and other health conditions due to a lack of studies."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the effectiveness of workplace ergonomic interventions for improving worker satisfaction and productivity. Workplace ergonomic training may improve worker satisfaction, productivity and satisfaction with work, but there is a need for further research. The findings of this review should be interpreted with caution, as the conclusions are based on a small number of studies, with a high risk of bias, and are subject to interpretation and interpretation. Further research is needed to assess the effectiveness and effectiveness of these interventions, and to compare them to other types of ergonomic exercises."
271," The quantity and especially quality of data are low. Analysis shows a reduction in overall complications, but major complications were not reduced. Length of stay was reduced significantly. We state that ERAS seems safe, but the quality of trials and lack of sufficient other outcome parameters do not justify implementation of ERAS as the standard of care. Within ERAS protocols included, no answer regarding the role for minimally invasive surgery (i.e. laparoscopy) was found. Furthermore, protocol compliance within ERAS programs has not been investigated, while this seems a known problem in the field. Therefore, more specific and large RCT's are needed."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of epidural analgesia for post-operative complications. Further research is needed to determine the optimal dose and duration of epidurals for postoperative complications, and to assess the effectiveness of the various analgesia in terms of pain relief, function, fatigue, sleepiness, fatigue and sleepiness. Finally, to evaluate the efficacy of intraoperative analgesia compared to epidural anaesthesia alone or in combination with other analgesia, to compare the effectiveness and safety of epiduran analgesia versus epidural opioid analgesia alone."
272," ESA treatment in cancer patients increased on study mortality and worsened overall survival. For patients undergoing chemotherapy the increase was less pronounced, but an adverse effect could not be excluded."," Red blood cell transfusion does not appear to have a significant effect on survival or quality of life in patients with advanced cancer receiving chemotherapy. However, it does appear to reduce the risk of death and the need for transfusion in these patients. Red blood cells transfusion is associated with a reduction in the incidence of adverse events, including blood transfusion-related deaths, and a decrease in blood transfusions-related mortality. Red-blood transfusion therapy appears to be associated with an increased risk of infection and a decreased risk of transfusion failure, but the exact extent of this risk is unclear."
273," Use of either doxycycline 200 mg or azithromycin 500 mg by mouth before IUD insertion confers little benefit. While the reduction in unscheduled visits to the provider was marginally significant, the cost-effectiveness of routine prophylaxis remains questionable. A uniform finding in these trials was the low risk of IUD-associated infection, with or without use of antibiotic prophylaxis."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the effectiveness of IUD removal for PID. Further randomized controlled trials are needed to determine the effectiveness and safety of this treatment. Such trials should be undertaken in the context of a well-defined group of patients who are at high risk of PID, and those who are unable to tolerate the treatment. They should also include those patients who do not have a history of PID and those patients with an elevated incidence of PID. Such tests should be carried out in a separate setting, with appropriate attention to detail."
274," Methotrexate may have a small steroid sparing effect in adults with asthma who are dependent on oral corticosteroids. However, the overall reduction in daily steroid use is probably not large enough to reduce steroid-induced adverse effects. This small potential to reduce the impact of steroid side-effects is probably insufficient to offset the adverse effects of methotrexate."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of corticosteroids in the treatment of patients with chronic asthma. Further randomized controlled trials are needed to determine the optimal dose and duration of steroids and to compare the effectiveness of these drugs in the management of these patients. Finally, a randomized controlled trial is needed to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of these medications in treating patients with severe asthma. Such trials are also needed to assess the efficacy and safety, and to determine whether the dose is appropriate for each patient and their circumstances."
275," Quetiapine may not differ from typical antipsychotics in the treatment of positive symptoms and general psychopathology. There are no clear differences in terms of the treatment of negative symptoms. However, it causes fewer adverse effects in terms of abnormal ECG, extrapyramidal effects, abnormal prolactin levels and weight gain."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of benzodiazepines in the treatment of negative symptoms of depression or dyskinesia. Further research is needed to determine the optimal dose and duration of benzadiazepines, the optimal dosage, and the optimal duration of treatment. Finally, future research should focus on improving the quality of life of people with depression and Dyskinesias, as well as assessing the effectiveness of other drugs, such as antidepressants and antidepressants."
276," Certain settings of care (i.e. high volume of HIV positive patients) and models of care (i.e. case management) may improve patient mortality and other outcomes. More detailed descriptions of care models, consistent definition of terms, and studies on innovative models suitable for developing countries are needed. There is not yet enough evidence to guide policy and clinical care in this area."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the effectiveness of any of the interventions included in this review in terms of reducing mortality and disability in hospital wards. Further research is needed to determine the effectiveness and effectiveness of these interventions in reducing mortality, disability and morbidity in hospitals, and to compare them to each other. It is also important to understand the mechanisms by which these interventions are implemented, and how they are implemented in different settings, settings and settings."
277," Interventions to improve water quality are generally effective in preventing diarrhoea, and interventions to improve water quality at the household level are more effective than those at the source. Significant heterogeneity among the trials suggests that the actual level of effectiveness may depend on a variety of conditions that research to date cannot fully explain. Rigorous, blinded, multi-arm randomized controlled trials conducted over a longer duration in a variety if settings may help clarify the potential effectiveness."," Water disinfection is effective in reducing diarrhoea incidence and reducing water contamination in households. It is not clear whether water disinfection has a beneficial effect on the incidence or severity of diarrhea or on water contamination. Water disinfections are effective in decreasing diarrhoeal morbidity in households, but there is a need for further research into the effectiveness of disinfection and disinfection in households with water contamination, and in households without water purification or disinfection."
278," Ice massage compared to control had a statistically beneficial effect on ROM, function and knee strength. Cold packs decreased swelling. Hot packs had no beneficial effect on edema compared with placebo or cold application. Ice packs did not affect pain significantly, compared to control, in patients with OA. More well designed studies with a standardized protocol and adequate number of participants are needed to evaluate the effects of thermotherapy in the treatment of OA of the knee."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the effectiveness of acupuncture for pain relief in adults with osteoporosis. Further research is needed to assess the effectiveness and safety of acupuncture in adults. It is also important to understand the mechanisms by which acupuncture works, and how it relates to pain relief and function, and to compare acupuncture with other types of pain relief. Finally, there is a need for a meta-analysis of the effects of acupuncture on quality of life and satisfaction with pain relief, pain management and function."
279," Insertion of an IUD immediately after abortion is safe and practical. IUD expulsion rates appear higher than after interval insertions. However, IUD use is higher at six months with immediate than with interval insertion."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the effectiveness of IUD insertion as an adjunct to pelvic floor cleaning in preventing accidental vaginal bleeding or accidental vaginal discharge from the IUD. Further research is needed to determine the effectiveness and safety of this intervention as an adjuvant treatment for unintentional vaginal discharge and to assess its effectiveness as a complement to pelvic floors cleaning in the management of accidental vaginal leakage from a tubal tubal basin. Finally, future research should focus on assessing its effectiveness in reducing the incidence of unintended vaginal discharge, and on determining its safety and effectiveness."
280," Implications for practice Oral borage oil and evening primrose oil lack effect on eczema; improvement was similar to respective placebos used in trials. Oral BO and EPO are not effective treatments for eczema. In these studies, along with the placebos, EPO and BO have the same, fairly common, mild, transient adverse effects, which are mainly gastrointestinal. The short-term studies included here do not examine possible adverse effects of long-term use of EPO or BO. A case report warned that if EPO is taken for a prolonged period of time (more than one year), there is a potential risk of inflammation, thrombosis, and immunosuppression; another study found that EPO may increase bleeding for people on Coumadin® (warfarin) medication. Implications for research Noting that the confidence intervals between active and placebo treatment are narrow, to exclude the possibility of any clinically useful difference, we concluded that further studies on EPO or BO for eczema would be hard to justify. This review does not provide information about long-term use of these products."," There is no evidence to support or refute the use of omega-3 fatty acids in the treatment of people with atopic dermatitis. There is a need for further well-designed, well-conducted and reported randomized controlled trials to evaluate the effects of omega 3 fatty acids on skin colour, texture, texture and texture, and to compare the effects on skin color and texture. Finally, there is an urgent need for a standardised assessment of the efficacy and safety of omega 2 fatty acids for dermatitis and psoriasis, as well as a standard assessment of quality of life."
281," Longitudinal studies consistently suggest that exposure to tobacco advertising and promotion is associated with the likelihood that adolescents will start to smoke. Based on the strength and specificity of this association, evidence of a dose-response relationship, the consistency of findings across numerous observational studies, temporality of exposure and smoking behaviours observed, as well as the theoretical plausibility regarding the impact of advertising, we conclude that tobacco advertising and promotion increases the likelihood that adolescents will start to smoke."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the existence of a positive effect of media ads on smoking risk factors in children and adolescents. There is a need for further research into the effects of media adverts on risk factors, such as smoking prevalence and relapse rates, and the effectiveness of media advertisements in the prevention of relapse and relapse. Such studies should focus on identifying the most effective media ads and the most appropriate media ads for each type of media advertisement. They should also include measures of relapse, relapse, quality of life and relapse rate."
282," Naltrexone appears to be an effective and safe strategy in alcoholism treatment. Even though the sizes of treatment effects might appear moderate in their magnitudes, these should be valued against the background of the relapsing nature of alcoholism and the limited therapeutic options currently available for its treatment."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the effectiveness of psychosocial interventions for the treatment of alcohol dependence. Further research is needed to determine the effectiveness and safety of psychotherapy for alcohol dependence, and also to assess the efficacy of psychotherapeutic interventions for other types of alcoholic dependence, such as cocaine or cocaine, as well as to assess whether psychotherapy is more effective than no treatment or no treatment at all. Finally, future research should focus on assessing the efficacy, safety and efficacy of psychological therapies for alcoholism, and on assessing their effectiveness in reducing alcohol dependence and relapse."
283," Stapled hemorrhoidopexy is associated with a higher long-term risk of hemorrhoid recurrence and the symptom of prolapse. It is also associated with a higher likelihood of long-term symptom recurrence and the need for additional operations compared to conventional excisional hemorrhoid surgeries. Patients should be informed of these risks when being offered the stapled hemorrhoidopexy as surgical therapy. If hemorrhoid recurrence and prolapse are the most important clinical outcomes, then conventional excisional surgery remains the ""gold standard"" in the surgical treatment of internal hemorrhoids."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of any of the recommended analgesic agents in the treatment of postoperative pain relief in terms of reduction in blood loss, reduction in prolapse recurrence, and improvement in quality of life compared to standard anaesthesia. Further research is needed to determine the optimal analgesic regime and the optimal dosage and duration of analgesia, and to compare different analgesic regimens. Finally, future research should evaluate the effectiveness of various analgesics in the management of postop pain relief and recovery from postoperative complications."
284," We cannot make any definite statements on the efficacy and clinical usefulness of electrotherapy modalities for neck pain. Since the quality of evidence is low or very low, we are uncertain about the estimate of the effect. Further research is very likely to change both the estimate of effect and our confidence in the results. Current evidence for PEMF, rMS, and TENS shows that these modalities might be more effective than placebo but not other interventions. Funding bias should be considered, especially in PEMF studies. Galvanic current, iontophoresis, electric muscle stimulation(EMS), and static magnetic field did not reduce pain or disability. Future trials on these interventions should have larger patient samples and include more precise standardization and description of all treatment characteristics."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of TENS in the treatment of neck pain. Further research is needed to identify the optimal TENS regime, the optimal intensity and duration of TES, and the best way to deliver TENS to people with chronic pain. Finally, there is a need for further evaluation of the effectiveness of Tens in chronic pain, and to compare TENS with TENS, TENS and TENS for pain relief and function."
285," There is insufficient evidence to claim or refute a benefit for any antifungal agent in treating candidiasis. Further well designed, placebo-controlled trials assessing the effectiveness of old and new interventions for treating oral candidiasis are needed. Clinicians need to make a decision on whether to prevent or treat oral candidiasis in patients receiving treatment for cancer."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of prophylactic antibiotics in the treatment of candidiasis. Further research is needed to establish the effectiveness of these agents in terms of efficacy, tolerability and safety, as well as the optimal dose and duration of antibiotic therapy in candidiasis, and to compare these agents to each other. Finally, future trials should evaluate the efficacy and safety of antibiotic treatment, and also assess the effectiveness and effectiveness of antibiotic regimens, and the duration of treatment, respectively."
286," Patients with Parkinson's disease who receive treadmill training are more likely to improve their impaired gait hypokinesia. However, the results must be interpreted with caution because there were variations between the trials in patient characteristics, the duration and amount of training, and types of treatment. Additionally, it is not known how long these improvements may last."," Walking distance and speed tests are effective in improving walking distance and walking speed in patients with Parkinson's disease. Improvement in walking distance, speed and stride length were not significantly different from decreases in walking speed or speed. However, the results are based on a small number of short-term studies with a high risk of bias. Further research is needed to assess the effects of walking distance tests on walking speed and speed and to evaluate the effectiveness of treadmill tests in reducing falls and falling."
287, The results of this review show that airway clearance techniques have short-term effects in the terms of increasing mucus transport. No evidence was found on which to draw conclusions concerning the long-term effects.," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of CPAP in the management of lung function in people with chronic lung disease. There is a need for further well-designed and executed randomised controlled trials to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of this therapy in these patients. Such trials should be of high methodological quality, with a focus on assessing the effectiveness of the therapy in the treatment of these patients, as well as on the long-term effects of the treatment. They should also evaluate the effect of the intervention on lung function and on breathing capacity."
288," This review shows a beneficial effect of EWS in time to recurrence, percentage of people hospitalised and functioning in people with bipolar disorder. However, the absence of data on the primary outcome measure in so many included studies is a source of concern and a potential source of bias. Mental health services should consider routinely providing EWS interventions to adults with bipolar disorder, as they appear to reduce hospitalisation and therefore may be cost-effective."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the effectiveness of psychotherapy for relapses of depression or bipolar disorder. There is a need for well-designed and executed randomised controlled trials to evaluate psychotherapy as an adjunct to other psychotherapy approaches to depression and bipolar disorder, as well as to compare psychotherapy with other psychological therapies. Such trials should be conducted in a variety of settings, with appropriate attention paid to outcome measures and time to relapse and duration."
289," Children with ALL treated with CSF benefit from shorter hospitalisation and fewer infections. However, there was no evidence of shortened duration of neutropenia nor fewer treatment delays. There was also no useful information about survival. The role of CSF in the context of febrile neutropenia episodes is still uncertain. Although current data show statistical benefit with CSF use, substantial heterogeneity between included trials does not allow this conclusion."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of G-CSF as a prophylactic agent for the treatment of acute neutropenia. Further research is needed to determine the optimal dose, duration, and duration of therapy, as well as the best dose and timing of therapy and to compare the effects of these agents on survival and quality of life in patients with this condition. In addition, future research should evaluate the effectiveness and safety of these drugs in the management of this condition, and also evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of these treatments in particular."
290," We are not confident that cross-over studies are appropriate for this participant group as they are best for conditions that are stable and for interventions with no physiological and psychological carry-over. Sildenafil may be a useful option in the treatment of antipsychotic-induced sexual dysfunction in men with schizophrenia, but this conclusion is based only on one small short trial. Switching to olanzapine may improve sexual functioning in men and women, but the trial assessing this was a small, open label trial. Further well designed randomised control trials that are blinded and well conducted and reported, which investigate the effects of dose reduction, drug holidays, symptomatic therapy and switching antipsychotic on sexual function in people with antipsychotic-induced sexual dysfunction are urgently needed."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of testosterone in the treatment of sexual dysfunction in men with schizophrenia. Further research is needed to identify the optimal testosterone concentration and duration of testosterone therapy, the optimal dose, and the optimal frequency of testosterone injections. Finally, there is a need for further research into the effects of testosterone supplementation on sexual dysfunction, as well as the effectiveness of testosterone replacement therapy in preventing deterioration of sexual function in men who are suffering from schizophrenia or bipolar disorder."
291," There is some evidence that 'adding on' services (or linkages) may improve the utilisation and outputs of healthcare delivery. However, there is no evidence to date that a fuller form of integration improves healthcare delivery or health status. Available evidence suggests that full integration probably decreases the knowledge and utilisation of specific services and may not result in any improvements in health status. More rigorous studies of different strategies to promote integration over a wider range of services and settings are needed. These studies should include economic evaluation and the views of clients as clients' views will influence the uptake of integration strategies at the point of delivery and the effectiveness on community health of these strategies."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of condoms in the prevention of STI. Further research is needed to assess the effectiveness of condoms for STI prevention, and to determine whether condoms are effective in preventing STI, and whether they are safe and effective in reducing STI incidence. Further studies are also needed to determine the effectiveness and safety of condoms, as well as to assess contraceptive effectiveness and cost-effectiveness, and how best to tailor condoms to the needs of the population."
292," The risk of Rhesus D alloimmunisation during or immediately after a first pregnancy is about 1%. Administration of 100 µg (500 IU) anti-D to women in their first pregnancy can reduce this risk to about 0.2% without, to date, any adverse effects. Although unlikely to confer benefit in the current pregnancy, fewer women may have Rhesus D antibodies in any subsequent pregnancy, but the effects of this needs to be tested in studies of robust design."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the effectiveness of immunosuppressive agents in the treatment of DMD. Further research is needed to determine the effectiveness and safety of immunotherapy in DMD and to assess the effectiveness, safety and efficacy of these agents. Finally, there is a need for a meta-analysis of the efficacy and safety profiles of these treatments. Finally there is an issue of the quality of the evidence and the reliability of the results."
293, INO cannot be recommended for patients with AHRF. INO results in a transient improvement in oxygenation but does not reduce mortality and may be harmful.," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of nitric oxide as an adjunct to standard oxygen therapy in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome. Further research is needed to determine the optimal dose and duration of Nitric oxide therapy in these patients, and to compare the effectiveness and safety of this therapy with standard oxygen. Finally, to determine its effectiveness in the management of patients with severe AHRF, future research should focus on identifying the most effective dose and timing of administration, as well as the best dose, duration and duration."
294," If we assume that screening reduces breast cancer mortality by 15% and that overdiagnosis and overtreatment is at 30%, it means that for every 2000 women invited for screening throughout 10 years, one will avoid dying of breast cancer and 10 healthy women, who would not have been diagnosed if there had not been screening, will be treated unnecessarily. Furthermore, more than 200 women will experience important psychological distress including anxiety and uncertainty for years because of false positive findings. To help ensure that the women are fully informed before they decide whether or not to attend screening, we have written an evidence-based leaflet for lay people that is available in several languages on www.cochrane.dk. Because of substantial advances in treatment and greater breast cancer awareness since the trials were carried out, it is likely that the absolute effect of screening today is smaller than in the trials. Recent observational studies show more overdiagnosis than in the trials and very little or no reduction in the incidence of advanced cancers with screening."," Screening mammography for breast cancer is associated with a reduction in the incidence of death, but a significant increase in the rate of metastatic breast cancer. Screening for breast cancers for breast screening for breast reconstruction appears to have a beneficial effect on survival and quality of life. However, there is a need for further research to assess the effects of screening on survival, quality and time to progression and to compare screening with other methods of screening, including mammography in terms of time to death, and to evaluate the effectiveness of screening in the treatment of breast cancer mortality."
295, The lack of a positive effect of D-cycloserine on cognitive outcomes in controlled clinical trials with statistical power high enough to detect a clinically meaningful effect means that D-cycloserine has no place in the treatment of patients with Alzheimer's disease.," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of cognitive enhancers in the treatment of cognitive impairment in Alzheimer’s demented patients with dementia. Further research is needed to determine whether enhancers are beneficial or harmful in this patient population, and whether they are useful in the management of cognitive impairments in dementia, or whether enhancer therapy is beneficial in reducing cognitive impairment or dementia-like symptoms in these patients. The results of this review should be interpreted with caution, as the conclusions of the review are based on only a small number of patients, and the results of the two included studies were not representative of the whole range of dementia types."
296, HS reduces the volume of intravenous fluid required to maintain patients undergoing surgery but transiently increases serum sodium. It is not known if HS effects patient survival and morbidity but it should be tested in randomized clinical trials that are designed and powered to test these outcomes.," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of hydrocortisone in the treatment of hypotension in patients undergoing elective surgery. Further research is needed to determine the optimal hydrocORTisone formulation, the optimal dose, and the optimal dosage and timing of electrolyte administration. In addition, further research is also needed to assess the effectiveness of hydocortisones in reducing blood loss and blood loss in patients with hypotension during elective surgeries, and to assess their effects on mortality."
297," ICBI are effective tools for learning about sexual health, and they also show positive effects on self-efficacy, intention and sexual behaviour. More research is needed to establish whether ICBI can impact on biological outcomes, to understand how interventions might work, and whether they are cost-effective."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the effectiveness of self-evaluation tools for enhancing partner-selection behaviour. Further research is needed to identify the best tools to improve self-efficacy in partner selection, and to compare the effectiveness and effectiveness of various types of self assessment tools, and also to assess their effectiveness in the context of a variety of contexts, settings, and contexts. Finally, future research should focus on assessing the efficacy of self assessments and assessing the effectiveness, reliability, reliability and durability of self appraisal tools, as well as assessing their effectiveness."
298," We conclude that despite promising immunological responses no clinically effective antigen-specific active immunotherapy is yet available for ovarian cancer. Furthermore, the adoption of guidelines to ensure uniformity in trial conduct, response definitions and trial reporting is recommended to improve quality and comparability of immunotherapy trials."," Immunogenicity and immunogenicity are similar in terms of efficacy and safety. However, the risk of toxicity is higher in those receiving an immunogenetic antibody, and in those who are receiving an adjuvant vaccine. The risk of adverse events is lower with an ELISA antibody, but the number needed to treat is much higher with a ELISA vaccine. There is a need for further well-designed, well-conducted and reported randomized controlled trials to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of ELISA vaccines, and to compare ELISA with ELISA."
299, The results clearly demonstrate the superiority of antipsychotic drugs compared to placebo in preventing relapse. This effect must be weighed against the side effects of antipsychotic drugs. Future studies should focus on outcomes of social participation and clarify the long-term morbidity and mortality associated with these drugs.," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of paliperidone palmitate for the treatment of time-to-relapse in people with schizophrenia. Further research is needed to identify the optimal dose and duration of piliperidones, the optimal dosage and timing of administration, and the optimal timing of discontinuation. Finally, future research should focus on the long-term efficacy and safety of these drugs, as well as on the mechanisms by which they are used in the management of relapse."
300, The evidence suggests that providing early orthodontic treatment for children with prominent upper front teeth is no more effective than providing one course of orthodontic treatment when the child is in early adolescence.," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of orthopaedic braces for skeletal deformity in adults with malocclusion of the upper incisors. Further research is needed to establish the effectiveness and durability of these braces, as well as to compare the effectiveness of these devices to other types of braces, and to compare these to each other in terms of deformity and bone deformity. Finally, future research should focus on the evaluation of structural deformity, and on determining the optimal type and duration of treatment, and also on the optimal length of treatment."
301," There is insufficient evidence to determine possible advantages or disadvantages of immediate, immediate-delayed or delayed implants, therefore these preliminary conclusions are based on few underpowered trials often judged to be at high risk of bias. There is a suggestion that immediate and immediate-delayed implants may be at higher risks of implant failures and complications than delayed implants on the other hand the aesthetic outcome might be better when placing implants just after teeth extraction. There is not enough reliable evidence supporting or refuting the need for augmentation procedures at immediate implants placed in fresh extraction sockets or whether any of the augmentation techniques is superior to the others."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of soft tissue as a substitute for soft tissue for soft tissues in the treatment of Implant deformity. Further research is needed to determine whether soft tissue is superior to soft tissue in terms of bone loss, bone regeneration and bone regeneration, bone thickness, bone density, bone integrity and bone density. Finally, there is a need for further research into soft tissue soft tissues as a replacement for rigid tissue soft tissue."
302," Dietitians were better than doctors at lowering blood cholesterol in the short to medium term, but there was no evidence that they were better than self-help resources. There was no evidence that dietitians provided better outcomes than nurses.The results should be interpreted with caution as the studies were not of good quality and the analysis was based on a limited number of trials."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of dietary fibre supplements in the management of weight loss in overweight or obese individuals with diabetes mellitus. Further research is needed to establish the effectiveness of fibre supplements for weight loss, and to assess the effects of fiber supplements on health-related quality of life and physical fitness. Finally, long-term data are needed to determine whether fibre supplements are beneficial or harmful for overweight or obesity in obese patients with a history of cardiovascular disease."
303," The review indicates low level evidence for the positive effects of neuropsychological rehabilitation in MS. Interventions included in the review were heterogeneous. Consequently, clinical inferences can basically be drawn from single studies. Therefore, new trials may change the strength and direction of the evidence. To further strengthen the evidence, well-designed high quality studies are needed. In this systematic review, recommendations are given for improving the quality of future studies on the effects of neuropsychological rehabilitation in MS."," Cognitive training may improve cognitive performance in people with MS. However, there is insufficient evidence to support or refute its use as an adjunct to other cognitive training programmes. Further research is needed to assess the effects of cognitive training on performance, quality of life, and fatigue, and to compare cognitive training with other training programmes, and also to assess fatigue, fatigue, mood, and cognitive functioning. Finally, future research should focus on assessing the effects on fatigue and cognitive function, and on assessing fatigue and mood, as well as on fatigue."
304," The results indicate that exercise has positive short-term effects on self-esteem in children and young people. Since there are no known negative effects of exercise and many positive effects on physical health, exercise may be an important measure in improving children's self-esteem. These conclusions are based on several small low-quality trials."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the effectiveness of physical fitness training for developing self-esteem or self-confidence. Further research is needed to establish the effectiveness and durability of these exercises, and to assess the effects of training on self esteem and self confidence. Future research should focus on measuring self esteem, self confidence and self esteem in children and adolescents, as well as on assessing psychological fitness and self-efficacy in adults and children with developmental disabilities."
305," Intraventricular fibrinolytic therapy with streptokinase, given when post-hemorrhagic ventricular dilatation is established, cannot be recommended for neonates following IVH. A conservative approach with CSF drainage applied only to symptomatic raised intracranial pressure seems appropriate."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of antiplatelet agents in the treatment of endovascular fibrinolysis. Further research is needed to determine the effectiveness and safety of these agents, and to compare them with other antiplatelets. Finally, there is a need for a meta-analysis of the effects of platelet agents on the development of endopharyngeal fibrosis. This should be done in conjunction with an assessment of the effectiveness of anti-platelet drugs in the management of this condition."
306," The review identified no significant differences for the primary outcomes perinatal mortality, preterm birth less than 34 weeks' gestation, and childhood neurodevelopmental handicap, although the number of studies and participants was small. While treatment with heparin appears promising with a reduction in pre-eclampsia, eclampsia, and infant birthweight less than the 10th centile for gestational age, the number of studies and participants included was small, and to date important information about serious adverse infant and long-term childhood outcomes is unavailable. Further research is required. [Note: The 14 citations in the awaiting classification section of the review may alter the conclusions of the review once assessed.]"," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of prophylactic thromboembolic agents in the treatment of pre-eclampsia. Further research is needed to establish the effectiveness and safety of prothromycin and its analogues in this population, as well as to determine the optimal dose and timing of thromboprophylactic agents, and to compare the effectiveness of these agents with placebo or no treatment. Finally, there is a need for further research into the efficacy and safety aspects of these interventions."
307, Chemotherapy led to a small but significant benefit for overall survival and event-free survival. This benefit was essentially observed when chemotherapy was administered concomitantly with radiotherapy.," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of chemoradoxine as an adjuvant to radiotherapy in the treatment of metastatic lung cancer. Further research is needed to determine the optimal dose, duration and timing for chemoradiotherapy, and the optimal dosage and timing of chemotherapy, and to assess the optimal timing and duration of chemotherapy in these patients. Finally, future research should focus on determining the optimal doses and timing, duration, duration of chemotherapy and the most effective chemotherapy regimens for these patients, as well as the optimal duration of treatment."
308, The body of evidence summarised in this review is insufficient to allow any conclusion to be drawn about the use of pharmacological interventions in the treatment of antisocial personality disorder.," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of benzodiazepines for the treatment of aggressive aggression in people with drug-resistant aggression. Further research is needed to identify the optimal dose, duration and frequency, and the optimal dosage and timing of benzadiazepines in this population. Finally, there is a need for further research into the efficacy and effectiveness of psychosocial interventions for aggressive aggression, as well as the effectiveness of these interventions in reducing aggression in these populations."
309, Current evidence regarding the effectiveness of anticonvulsants in patients with tinnitus has significant risk of bias. There is no evidence from studies performed so far to show that anticonvulsants have a large positive effect in the treatment of tinnitus but a small effect (of doubtful clinical significance) has been demonstrated.," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the effectiveness of tinnitus management in the treatment of idiopathic tinnus. Further research is needed to determine the effectiveness and safety of this treatment. Finally, there is a need for a meta-analysis of the efficacy and safety profiles of tamnoside therapy in this setting. Finally there is an urgent need for an assessment of the effectiveness, safety and effectiveness of the tinnoside treatment in this population. Finally a review of the quality of the current evidence is warranted."
310," Bupropion increases smoking abstinence rates in smokers with schizophrenia, without jeopardizing their mental state. Varenicline may also improve smoking cessation rates in schizophrenia, but its possible psychiatric adverse effects cannot be ruled out. CR may help this group of patients to quit and reduce smoking in the short term. We failed to find convincing evidence that other interventions have a beneficial effect on smoking in schizophrenia."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the effectiveness of psychosocial interventions for reducing smoking behaviour in psychiatric patients with schizophrenia. Further research is needed to determine the effectiveness and safety of these interventions, and to compare them to each other, and also to compare the efficacy and effectiveness of these approaches to other psychiatric therapies. Finally, future research should focus on assessing the efficacy of psychoses and their effects on relapse rates and relapse rates, as well as on the severity of relapse and relapse."
311," There was insufficient evidence from comparisons tested within randomised controlled trials to establish the relative effectiveness of different, either custom-made or off-the-shelf, finger splints used for treating mallet finger injury. There was a useful reminder that splints used for prolonged immobilisation should be robust enough for everyday use, and of the central importance of patient adherence to instructions for splint use. There was insufficient evidence to determine when surgery is indicated."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of waterproof waterproofing in the treatment of skin imperfections. Further research is needed to determine whether waterproofing waterproofing is beneficial or harmful for the healing of imperfections in the skin imperfection of the innermost layers of the outermost layer of the skin. Further trials are also needed to assess the effectiveness of waterproofing, waterproofing and waterproofing on the inner innermost layer, and to compare waterproofing with waterproofing or waterproofing. Finally, trials are needed to evaluate the effectiveness and durability of waterproof outermost layers."
312," Prior to the current update it appeared there was some evidence that cranberry juice may decrease the number of symptomatic UTIs over a 12 month period, particularly for women with recurrent UTIs. The addition of 14 further studies suggests that cranberry juice is less effective than previously indicated. Although some of small studies demonstrated a small benefit for women with recurrent UTIs, there were no statistically significant differences when the results of a much larger study were included. Cranberry products were not significantly different to antibiotics for preventing UTIs in three small studies. Given the large number of dropouts/withdrawals from studies (mainly attributed to the acceptability of consuming cranberry products particularly juice, over long periods), and the evidence that the benefit for preventing UTI is small, cranberry juice cannot currently be recommended for the prevention of UTIs. Other preparations (such as powders) need to be quantified using standardised methods to ensure the potency, and contain enough of the 'active' ingredient, before being evaluated in clinical studies or recommended for use."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of cranberry supplements in the treatment of symptomatic UTI. There is a need for further research in this area, particularly in the context of the development of new antibiotics, and in combination with the introduction of newer antibiotics. Finally, it is important to note that cranberry supplementing is associated with an increased risk of bacterial contamination and bacterial contamination, as well as a decreased risk of infection, as compared to placebo."
313," No significant differences were found between triflusal and aspirin for secondary prevention of serious vascular events in patients with stroke or TIA and AMI. However, our review cannot exclude moderate differences in efficacy. Triflusal was associated with a lower risk of hemorrhagic complications."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of tranexamic acid in the treatment of non-fatal acute myocardial infarction, or to support its use as an alternative to aspirin in the management of these patients. There is a need for further research in this area, especially in the context of the introduction of antiplatelet agents, as well as in the development of new antiplatelets, such as ibuprofen, ibupropubic acid, and aspirin, in patients with a history of vascular death."
314," Despite concerns surrounding the use of opioids for long-term management of chronic LBP, there remain few high-quality trials assessing their efficacy. The trials in this review, although achieving high internal validity scores, were characterized by a lack of generalizability, inadequate description of study populations, poor intention-to treat analyses, and limited interpretation of functional improvement. Based on our results, the benefits of opioids in clinical practice for the long-term management of chronic LBP remain questionable. Therefore, further high-quality studies that more closely simulate clinical practice are needed to assess the usefulness, and potential risks, of opioids for individuals with chronic LBP."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of ibuprofen for pain relief in adults with chronic pain. Further randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm the efficacy and safety, and to assess the effectiveness and safety of ibiprofen in children with acute pain. Such trials are also needed to evaluate the effectiveness of ibaprofen as a substitute for other analgesics, such as oxytocin, ibuprogel, and aspirin, as well as to assess its effectiveness in children and adolescents."
315," We found strong evidence to support beneficial effects of child obesity prevention programmes on BMI, particularly for programmes targeted to children aged six to 12 years. However, given the unexplained heterogeneity and the likelihood of small study bias, these findings must be interpreted cautiously. A broad range of programme components were used in these studies and whilst it is not possible to distinguish which of these components contributed most to the beneficial effects observed, our synthesis indicates the following to be promising policies and strategies: · school curriculum that includes healthy eating, physical activity and body image · increased sessions for physical activity and the development of fundamental movement skills throughout the school week · improvements in nutritional quality of the food supply in schools · environments and cultural practices that support children eating healthier foods and being active throughout each day · support for teachers and other staff to implement health promotion strategies and activities (e.g. professional development, capacity building activities) · parent support and home activities that encourage children to be more active, eat more nutritious foods and spend less time in screen based activities However, study and evaluation designs need to be strengthened, and reporting extended to capture process and implementation factors, outcomes in relation to measures of equity, longer term outcomes, potential harms and costs. Childhood obesity prevention research must now move towards identifying how effective intervention components can be embedded within health, education and care systems and achieve long term sustainable impacts."," Dietary fruit and vegetables are effective in reducing body weight and improving physical fitness in children and adolescents. They are also associated with a reduction in BMI, BMI and triglycerides, and a decreased risk of cardiovascular disease. They also appear to have a positive effect on BMI and on triglycerides and on blood pressure. They do not appear to be associated with an increase in BMI or triglycerides. They may have a negative impact on BMI or on triglyceride levels. Their effect on body mass is not clear. Their effects on BMI are not clear from this review, but they should be viewed with caution."
316," Olanzapine is an effective treatment for mania and may be more efficacious than divalproex, though leads to more weight gain. Clinicians should consider both the relative efficacy and the different incidence of specific adverse effects of available drugs."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of antidepressants in the treatment of depressive symptoms. Further research is needed to identify the best antidepressant for depressive symptoms and the best combination of antidepressant and antidepressant therapy for these conditions. Finally, there is a need for a meta-analysis of the effects of antidepressant therapy on depressive symptoms, and a comparison of antidepressant medication with placebo or no treatment or other antidepressant treatments for depressive episodes. Finally there is an issue of the quality of the evidence and the reliability of the results."
317," There is limited evidence that contracts can potentially contribute to improving adherence, but there is insufficient evidence from large, good quality studies to routinely recommend contracts for improving adherence to treatment or preventive health regimens."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the effectiveness of psychological interventions for enhancing adherence to alcohol treatment. Further research is needed to assess the effectiveness and safety of psychological therapies for reducing compliance with alcohol treatment, and to compare psychological interventions with other types of alcohol treatment (e.g. alcohol counselling, behavioural counselling, cognitive behavioural therapy, counselling, counselling). Finally, there is a need for further research into psychological interventions to improve the quality of life of people with alcohol problems."
318, There is insufficient evidence from randomised trials to establish the best strategies for enhancing mobility after hip fracture surgery.," Functional strength training appears to have a beneficial effect on walking speed, balance and function in the short-term, but is associated with a significant increase in falls and disability. Strength training may have a positive effect on fitness, but its effect on disability is not clear from this review. Further research is needed to assess the effects of strength training on fitness and disability, and to compare strength training with other types of physical rehabilitation, and also to evaluate the effects on fatigue and disability in the longer term."
319," In asthmatic subjects with gastro-oesophageal reflux, (but who were not recruited specifically on the basis of reflux-associated respiratory symptoms), there was no overall improvement in asthma following treatment for gastro-oesophageal reflux. Subgroups of patients may gain benefit, but it appears difficult to predict responders."," There is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of any particular form of antihypertensive medication in the treatment of GOR. Further research is needed to determine the optimal dose and duration of therapy and to compare the effectiveness of different types of anticholinergics in GOR, and to assess the effects of different combinations of antitholinergic drugs on GOR in patients with asthma and in those with GOR who do not have a history of asthma or who do have a high risk of respiratory distress syndrome."
320," This review indicates that swimming training is well-tolerated in children and adolescents with stable asthma, and increases lung function (moderate strength evidence) and cardio-pulmonary fitness (high strength evidence). There was no evidence that swimming training caused adverse effects on asthma control in young people 18 years and under with stable asthma of any severity. However whether swimming is better than other forms of physical activity cannot be determined from this review. Further adequately powered trials with longer follow-up periods are needed to better assess the long-term benefits of swimming."," Physiorespiratory fitness tests are effective in improving lung function in children and adults with asthma, but they do not appear to have a clinically meaningful effect on lung function or respiratory rate. They do not seem to have an effect on respiratory rate or lung function. They may have an impact on pulmonary function and respiratory rate, but there is a need for further well-designed studies to evaluate the effects of exercise training on respiratory rates, respiratory rate and lung function, as well as on pulmonary functions and respiratory rates."
321, This review found a beneficial effect of banding ligation on primary prevention of upper gastrointestinal bleeding in patient with oesophageal varices. The effect on bleeding did not reduce mortality. Additional evidence is needed to determine whether our results reflect that non-selective beta-blockers have other beneficial effects than on bleeding.," Prophylactic bandaging is effective in reducing the incidence of variceal hemorrhage and reducing the risk of death, but the extent to which this effect is achieved is unclear. The number needed to remove bandaging from the bandaging does not appear to be affected by the use of bandaging, but it is possible that bandaging may have a role in reducing blood loss, but this conclusion is based on a small number of trials and uncertainties. Further research is needed to identify the optimal bandaging and the best bandaging method."
322," The main source of evidence for the current practice of laparoscopic excision of renal cancer is drawn from case series, small retrospective studies and very few small randomised controlled trials. The results and conclusions of these studies must therefore be interpreted with caution."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of trocars in orthopedic surgery. Further randomized controlled trials are needed to determine whether trocars are beneficial or harmful for orthopaedic surgery in this population. Such trials should be undertaken in the context of a well-defined set of outcomes, such as complication rates and length of hospital stay, as well as the extent to which trocars may be useful in this patient population. These trials should include a number of parameters, including length of stay, severity of infection, and duration of recovery."
323," Providing additional placental blood to the preterm baby by either delaying cord clamping for 30 to 120 seconds, rather than early clamping, seems to be associated with less need for transfusion, better circulatory stability, less intraventricular haemorrhage (all grades) and lower risk for necrotising enterocolitis. However, there were insufficient data for reliable conclusions about the comparative effects on any of the primary outcomes for this review."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of intravenous transfusion as a means of reducing blood transfusion rates. Further research is needed to determine the best method of transfusion and the best way to administer transfusion to patients with pre-existing congenital heart defects. Finally, there is a need for further investigation of the effectiveness of transfusions as an alternative to intravenous immunoglobulins in reducing blood loss in the first week of life."
324," Based on the limited evidence found we cannot conclude whether thrombolytic therapy is better than heparin for pulmonary embolism. More double-blind RCTs, with subgroup analysis of patients presenting with haemodynamically stable acute pulmonary embolism compared to those patients with a haemodynamic unstable condition, are required."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of ipratropium for the treatment of streptococcal infections. Further research is needed to determine the optimal dose, duration and timing, and the best way to administer ipratrepium for these infections, and to compare the effectiveness and safety of these drugs in terms of reducing blood loss and mortality. Finally, to assess the efficacy and safety, a meta-analysis of the data is needed."
325," When the possible side-effects of standard treatment (hypnotics) are considered, there is an argument to be made for clinical use of cognitive-behavioural treatments. Research is needed to establish the likely predictors of success with such treatments. As it may well be the case that the treatment efficacy of cognitive-behavioural therapy itself is not durable, the provision of ""top-up"" (""refresher"" sessions of CBT training to improve durability of effect are worthy of investigation."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the effectiveness of relaxation exercises in sleep disturbance. Further research is needed to determine whether relaxation exercises are beneficial for sleep disturbance, wakefulness, sleep disturbance or sleep disturbance in people with insomnia, and to assess the effects on sleep disturbance and sleep disturbance on quality of life, sleep disturbances and sleep disturbances. Further studies are also needed to evaluate relaxation exercises for sleep disturbances, sleep deprivation, sleeplessness, sleepiness and sleep deprivation in people who are awake or asleep at night."
326," Based on the findings of three small RCTs of moderate to severely poisoned patients, glucocorticoid with cyclophosphamide in addition to standard care may be a beneficial treatment for patients with paraquat-induced lung fibrosis. To enable further study of the effects of glucocorticoid with cyclophosphamide for patients with moderate to severe paraquat poisoning, hospitals may provide this treatment as part of an RCT with allocation concealment."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the existence of a mechanism of action to reduce mortality or improve quality of life. Further research is needed to identify the mechanism by which this mechanism works, and to compare the effectiveness of this intervention with other methods of action in the management of mortality and morbidity in adults with dementia or in children with dementia. Finally, to determine the effectiveness and safety of this method of action, a meta-analysis will be undertaken."
327," The findings of this review indicate that the number of systemic and topical drugs used for the different subforms of pruritus is increasing. Different interventions have been shown to be effective in the treatment of pruritus of different origins. Nevertheless, an optimal therapy for pruritus is constrained due to the limited understanding of crucial itch mediators and receptors in the various subforms of itch. Ideal antipruritic therapies are still lacking, especially for palliative care patients. This systematic review also indicates that there is insufficient evidence to give any concrete recommendations regarding treatment of pruritus in palliative care patients. Due to the very small sample sizes and poor methodological quality of the majority of studies that were included, the results of this review need to be interpreted with caution. Furthermore, the generalizability is questionable. Additional studies, and particularly carefully designed treatment trials, are needed to provide valid evidence for adequate treatment of pruritus in palliative care patients."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of corticosteroids in the treatment of pruritus. Further randomized controlled trials are needed to determine the optimal dose and duration of steroids and to assess the effectiveness of these drugs in the management of pruriaitus. Finally, long-term data are needed on the effects of steroids on quality of life and productivity. Long-term studies are also needed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of steroids, and to compare the effectiveness and effectiveness of steroids in the control group of patients."
328," Chemotherapy significantly improves survival in comparison to best supportive care. In addition, combination chemotherapy improves survival compared to single-agent 5-FU. All patients should be tested for their HER-2 status and trastuzumab should be added to a standard fluoropyrimidine/cisplatin regimen in patients with HER-2 positive tumours. Two and three-drug regimens including 5-FU, cisplatin, with or without an anthracycline, as well as irinotecan or docetaxel-containing regimens are reasonable treatment options for HER-2 negative patients."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of cisplatin as an adjunct to chemotherapy in terms of survival, toxicity, toxicity and survival. Further randomized controlled trials are needed to evaluate the effectiveness and toxicity profiles of these drugs in patients with advanced stages of renal toxicity. Such trials should be undertaken in accordance with the recommendations of the Cochrane Guidelines on Immunotherapy for renal toxicity in advanced stages renal toxicity, as well as in patients who are undergoing chemotherapy in advanced stage renal toxicity and those who are unable to tolerate chemotherapy in these patients."
329," Laparoscopic resection of carcinoma of the colon is associated with a long term outcome no different from that of open colectomy. Further studies are required to determine whether the incidence of incisional hernias and adhesions is affected by method of approach. Laparoscopic surgery for cancer of the upper rectum is feasible, but more randomised trials need to be conducted to assess long term outcome."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of parenteral anaesthesia as an adjunct to other surgical procedures in terms of minimising mortality and morbidity. Further research is needed to determine the optimal dose and duration of prenteral anhydrase inhibitors, the optimal duration of extracapsular excision, and the optimal timing of endoscopic excision. Finally, future research should focus on determining the optimal intensity and timing of anaesthesia and the most effective way of delivering anaesthesia to the patient."
330," Calcium antagonists reduce the risk of poor outcome and secondary ischaemia after aneurysmal SAH. The results for 'poor outcome' depend largely on a single large trial of oral nimodipine; the evidence for other calcium antagonists is inconclusive. The evidence for nimodipine is not beyond all doubt, but given the potential benefits and modest risks of this treatment, oral nimodipine is currently indicated in patients with aneurysmal SAH. Intravenous administration of calcium antagonists cannot be recommended for routine practice on the basis of the present evidence. Magnesium sulphate is a promising agent but more evidence is needed before definite conclusions can be drawn."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of antiplatelet agents in the treatment of vasospasm. There is a need for further research into the effects of platelet agents on arterial blood flow, and the effectiveness of these agents in reducing blood loss and bleeding in patients with a sub-group of patients who are at high risk of infection. Finally, there is an urgent need for a well-designed and executed randomised controlled trial to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of platelets and other agents for reducing blood flow and blood loss in people with a peripheral artery lesion."
331, Two trials are included in this review but no conclusions can be drawn for the benefit of co-acupressure for slowing progress of myopia in children. Further evidence in the form of RCTs are needed before any recommendations can be made for the use of acupuncture treatment in clinical use. These trials should compare acupuncture to placebo and have large sample sizes. Other types of acupuncture (such as auricular acupuncture) should be explored further as well as compliance with treatment for at least six months or longer. Axial length elongation of the eye should be investigated for at least one year. The potential to reduce/eliminate pain from acupuncture experienced by children should also be reviewed.," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the effectiveness of visual acuity training for visual health improvement in people with visual impairments. Further research is needed to determine the effectiveness and effectiveness of this training for people with impairments with visual impairment. It is also important to note that there is a need for further research in this area, as well as in other areas of visual impairment, such as in contrast to other types of training, and in contrast with other forms of training. Finally, there is an urgent need for a well-designed, well-conducted and reported randomized controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy and effectiveness, and to compare the effectiveness, safety and efficacy of various types of cognitive training."
332," There are too few data available to make definitive recommendations. More intensive forms of advance directive appear to show promise, but currently practice must be guided by evidence other than that derived from randomised trials. More trials are indicated to determine whether higher intensity interventions, such as joint crisis planning, have an effect on outcomes of clinical relevance."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of solitary confinement as a means of reducing the number of days spent as an involuntary ward in mental health facilities. Further research is needed to assess the effectiveness of solitary solitary confinement in isolation, and to compare solitary confinement with other forms of isolation in a population with a history of mental health problems, and also to assess how solitary confinement differs from isolation in terms of length of stay in a mental health facility."
333," There was a lower incidence of HIT and HIT complicated by VTE in postoperative patients undergoing thromboprophylaxis with LMWH compared with UFH. This is consistent with the current clinical use of LMWH over UFH as front-line heparin therapy. However, conclusions are limited by a scarcity of high quality evidence. We did not expect the paucity of RCTs including HIT as an outcome as heparin is one of the most commonly used drugs worldwide and HIT is a life-threatening adverse drug reaction. To address the scarcity of clinically-relevant information on the topic of HIT as a whole, HIT should be included as an outcome in future RCTs of heparin, and HIT as an adverse drug reaction should be considered in clinical recommendations regarding monitoring of the platelet count for HIT."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of prostaglandins for seroconversion. Further research is needed to determine the effectiveness of prostiglandins in seroconversions. It is also important to understand the mechanisms by which prostagLANDins are used to achieve their goal, and how they are used in the context of a reduction in extraneous extraneous organ prolapse. Further trials are also needed to assess the efficacy and safety, and to compare prostigLANDins with other treatments, such as oxytocin, ibuprofen and ibupropubic acid."
334, Current evidence suggests that antihistamine-analgesic-decongestant combinations have some general benefit in adults and older children. These benefits must be weighed against the risk of adverse effects. There is no evidence of effectiveness in young children.," There is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of ibuprofen in the treatment of nasal congestion in patients with a common cold. There is a need for further research in this area, particularly in patients who are at high risk of complications, and in those who are unable to tolerate the drug. Finally, there is an urgent need for a well-designed and executed randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effectiveness of ibiprofen for the treatment and prevention of congestion in the common cold, and to evaluate its effectiveness in other chronic cold conditions."
335," There was insufficient robust evidence from randomised trials to establish the relative effectiveness of different methods of anaesthesia, different associated physical techniques or the use of drug adjuncts in the treatment of distal radial fractures. There is, however, some indication that haematoma block provides poorer analgesia than IVRA, and can compromise reduction. Given the many unresolved questions over the management of these fractures, we suggest an integrated programme of research, which includes consideration of anaesthesia options, is the way forward."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of hydrocolloid gel as a substitute for other analgesics in the treatment of acute pain fractures. Further research is needed to establish the effectiveness of Hydrocolloids gel as an adjunct to other analgesic treatments for pain relief in adults with fractures of the innermost limb, and to determine the optimal dose and duration of hydocolloid therapy. Finally, future trials should evaluate the effectiveness and durability of hydropolloid treatment for acute pain relief, as well as the efficacy and durability, in adults and children."
336," In patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis whose disease is refractory to conventional treatment using corticosteroids and/or immunosuppressive agents, infliximab is effective in inducing clinical remission, inducing clinical response, promoting mucosal healing, and reducing the need for colectomy at least in the short term. Serious adverse events attributable to infliximab were not common in the included studies but physicians should be aware of and be prepared to deal with potential adverse events such as anaphylactic reactions and infections."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of corticosteroids in the treatment of patients with ulcerative colitis. Further research is needed to determine the optimal dose and duration of steroids and to assess the effectiveness of these drugs in the management of these patients. Finally, there is a need for further research into the efficacy and safety of these medications in treating patients with mild to moderately severe disease, and also to evaluate the effectiveness and durability of these treatments in terms of their effectiveness and safety."
337, There is good evidence that cementing the prostheses in place will reduce post-operative pain and lead to better mobility. From the trials to date there is no evidence of any difference in outcome between bipolar and unipolar prosthesis. There is some evidence that a total hip replacement leads to better functional outcome than a hemiarthroplasty. Further well-conducted randomised trials are required.," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of any specific type of orthopaedic instrument in the treatment of post-operative hememorrhagic complications. There is a need for further well-designed, conducted and reported randomised controlled trials to evaluate the effectiveness of orthopedic instrumentation in reducing mortality and morbidity in postoperative hemmorrhagic injuries. Such trials should be undertaken in the context of a large number of patients, with a high risk of bias, and with a low risk of random errors."
338," Although EMLA is an effective topical anaesthetic for children, amethocaine is superior in preventing pain associated with needle procedures."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of topical gel gel gel as a substitute for topical gel in the treatment of venous puncture pain. Further research is needed to determine whether gel gel is more effective than gel gel in relieving pain or discomfort in patients with venous occlusion pain, or if gel gel should be used in conjunction with gel gel or gel gel, or in combination with other gel preparations. Further trials are also needed to assess the effectiveness of gel gel and gel gel for pain relief in patients undergoing venous epinephrine injections."
339," The overall quality of evidence was moderate. Half of these postpartum interventions led to fewer repeat pregnancies or births or more contraceptive use. However, the evidence of intervention effectiveness was of low to moderate quality. Trials with evidence of effectiveness included two that provided one or two sessions and three that had multiple contacts. The former had limitations, such as self-reported outcomes and showing no effect for many comparisons. The interventions with multiple sessions were promising but would have to be adapted for other locations and then retested. Researchers and health care providers will have to determine which intervention might be appropriate for their setting and level of resources."," Learning aids are effective in reducing the incidence of repeat birth. Learning aids may reduce the frequency of unintended pregnancies, but they do not appear to have a significant impact on maternal satisfaction with learning aids. Further research is needed to assess the effectiveness of learning aids in reducing repeat birth rates, and to assess their effectiveness in reducing unintended pregnancies. Research is also needed to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of educational aids in enhancing knowledge and informing parents about the risks and benefits of knowledge aids."
340," Due to insufficient good quality data and lack of randomised studies, it is impossible to determine whether drug treatment is safe and effective in the treatment of myotonia. Larger, well-designed randomised controlled trials are needed to assess the efficacy and tolerability of drug treatment for myotonia."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of ergostasis for the treatment of myotonia. Further research is needed to determine whether ergostasone is beneficial or harmful for people with this condition, or whether it is beneficial for them to use it as an adjunct to other forms of physical activity, such as walking, cycling, or other activities of daily life. It is also important to understand the mechanisms by which ergostasm works, as well as the mechanism by which it works, and to compare the effectiveness and safety of these interventions."
341," HPV-triage with HC2 can be recommended to triage women with ASCUS because it has higher accuracy (significantly higher sensitivity, and similar specificity) than repeat cytology. When triaging women with LSIL, an HC2 test yields a significantly higher sensitivity, but a significantly lower specificity, compared to a repeat cytology. Therefore, practice recommendations for management of women with LSIL should be balanced, taking local circumstances into account."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of cervical ultrasonography as a diagnostic tool for HPV testing. Further research is needed to identify the best cervical ultratorography technique and to assess the best way to achieve this objective. Finally, there is a need for further research into the effectiveness of ultrasonographic techniques in HPV testing, especially in terms of accuracy, specificity, and specificity. The results of this review should be interpreted with caution, as results are based on only a small number of studies and the results are not representative of the whole range of HPV testing methods."
342, The evidence derived from these limited studies suggests that 2000 mcg doses of oral vitamin B12 daily and 1000 mcg doses initially daily and thereafter weekly and then monthly may be as effective as intramuscular administration in obtaining short term haematological and neurological responses in vitamin B12 deficient patients.," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of hydrocobalamin for the treatment of cobalamin deficiency in people with Cobalamin deficient. Further research is needed to identify the optimal hydrocoubleasin formulation, the best formulation and timing of hydocobalamin supplementation, and the best way to administer it. In addition, there is a need for a well-designed and executed randomised controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of hydropobalamin in this population."
343," Three updates of this review have resulted in more included studies and more people randomised but still relatively little useful additional data. The results remain inconclusive. The new trials all compare the omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, in particular eicosapentaenoic acid and its ester, ethyl-eicosapentaenoic acid. The use of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids for schizophrenia still remains experimental and this review highlights the need for large, well designed, conducted and reported studies."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the existence of a beneficial effect of benzodiazepine for the treatment of PNSS. Further research is needed to confirm the existence and validity of these findings and to assess the effectiveness of these drugs in the management of PANSS. Recommendations are also needed to clarify the effectiveness and safety profile of benzadiazepine, as well as to assess its efficacy and tolerability, and to evaluate its effectiveness in other situations, such as insomnia or depression."
344," Caution is required in interpreting the results given the methodological limitations of the included trials in terms of internal and external validity. Further, the size and clinical meaningfulness of statistically significant results are uncertain. However, given the risks of untreated depression in terms of completed suicide and impacts on functioning, if a decision to use medication is agreed, then fluoxetine might be the medication of first choice given guideline recommendations. Clinicians need to keep in mind that there is evidence of an increased risk of suicide-related outcomes in those treated with antidepressant medications."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of antidepressants in the treatment of depression in children and adolescents with major depression. Further research is needed to identify the optimal antidepressant dose and duration, and to compare the efficacy of antidepressants with other antidepressants, as well as to evaluate the efficacy and safety of antidepressants for depression in these children or adolescents. Finally, to assess the effectiveness of antidepressant therapy in reducing depression severity and severity in these patients, a meta-analysis is required to determine the optimal dosage and duration of antidepressants."
345," A single injection of BtB was effective and safe for treating cervical dystonia. Long-term uncontrolled studies suggested that further injection cycles continue to work for most patients. Future research should explore technical factors such as the optimum treatment intervals and use of image or electromyographic guidance for administration. Other issues include service delivery, quality of life, long-term efficacy and safety, and the relative indications for BtA, BtB and other treatments such as deep brain stimulation"," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the effectiveness of ergonomic tools in the treatment of THDs. Further research is needed to determine whether ergonomic techniques are effective in reducing THDs in patients with THDs, or whether they should be used as a substitute for ergonomic methods in treating THDs with ergonomic materials. In addition, there is a need for further research into ergonomic technologies for THDs and other aspects of THD management."
346," There is insufficient evidence to support the routine use of any particular intervention either for pituitary down regulation, ovarian stimulation or adjuvant therapy in the management of poor responders to controlled ovarian stimulation in IVF. More robust data from good quality RCTs with relevant outcomes are needed."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of FSH in the treatment of mature oocytes. Further research is needed to determine whether FSH should be used for mature oocyte retrieval, the timing and duration of follicle retrieval, and the optimal timing and timing of administration in these oocytes, as well as the optimal dosage and timing. Finally, long-term follow-up data are needed to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of the FSH treatment in mature and developing oocytes and to compare the effectiveness of the various FSH regimens."
347, There is no consistent evidence from the limited number of studies that SERMs reduce the size of fibroids or improve clinical outcomes. Further studies are required to establish evidence of benefit of SERMs in treating women with uterine fibroids. This updated review did not find any new study for inclusion.," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of progestogens in the treatment of uterine leiomyoma. Further randomized controlled trials are needed to determine the optimal progestogen formulation and dosage, duration, and duration of treatment in this population. Such trials should include a number of patients, preferably with a high risk of bias, as well as follow-up of at least one year. Such studies should also assess the effects on quality of life, quality and quantity of life. They should also evaluate the effects of progesterone in the management of myocardial infarction."
348, No major advantages from any of the catheter-related interventions which have been purported to reduce the risk of PD peritonitis could be demonstrated in this review. The frequency and quality of available trials are suboptimal.," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of catheters in the treatment of peritonitis or exit site leaks. Catheters should not be used as a substitute for closed catheter systems in terms of catheter survival and catheter removal. Catheter removal should be carried out in accordance with the standard procedure, which should be followed by a catheter cleaning cycle. The use of a catheter cleaning cycle should be considered when determining the optimal catheter configuration and timing of removal."
349," Poor methodological quality, small sample sizes and the limited data available resulted in low precision of the statistical results and limited value of the overall results.The overall results show that there is no evidence for an effect of vasodilator drugs on primary Raynaud's phenomenon."," There is no evidence to support or refute the existence of a causal relationship between skin colouring and the frequency and severity of Raynaud's phenomenon. However, there is a need for further well-designed and executed randomised controlled trials to evaluate the effectiveness of skin colorning in the treatment of this common phenomenon. Such trials should be of high methodological quality, with a focus on identifying participants who are most likely to benefit from skin coloring. They should also include participants who have been diagnosed with a similar frequency of symptoms as those who are not."
350," Steam inhalation has not shown any consistent benefits in the treatment of the common cold, hence is not recommended in the routine treatment of common cold symptoms until more double-blind, randomised trials with a standardised treatment modality are conducted."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of aerosols in the treatment of nasal congestion. Further research is needed to identify the best aerosols for nasal congestion, and to compare aerosols to aerosols, as well as to assess the effectiveness of aerosol inhalation therapy in the management of respiratory distress syndrome. Finally, future research should focus on assessing the effectiveness and safety of aerosoles in nasal congestion and on identifying the most effective aerosols and the most efficient aerosols."
351," Currently, there is no evidence to suggest a protective effect of ischaemic preconditioning in non-cirrhotic patients undergoing liver resection under continuous vascular occlusion. Ischaemic preconditioning reduces the blood transfusion requirements in patients undergoing liver resection."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of prophylactic blood transfusion in post-operative liver loss. Further randomized controlled trials are needed to determine the effectiveness and safety of this intervention. Such trials should be undertaken in the absence of a documented adverse event profile. They should also evaluate the effects of transfusion on liver function and quality of life, and on mortality, liver function, liver autonomy and liver autonomy. They also should evaluate the effect of transfusions on liver autonomy, liver independence and liver function. They are also required to assess the effects on liver integrity and liver integrity."
352," Given that only three RCTs were included in this systematic review, and the high risk of bias in two of the three studies, there is insufficient evidence to either support, or refute, the use of lycopene for the prevention of prostate cancer. Similarly, there is no robust evidence from RCTs to identify the impact of lycopene consumption upon the incidence of prostate cancer, prostate symptoms, PSA levels or adverse events."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of any of the interventions in the treatment of prostate enlargement. Further research is needed to determine the effectiveness and safety of these interventions, and to assess the effectiveness of them in particular in the management of enlarged prostate, as well as the effects of them on quality of life and health-related productivity. Finally, to determine whether these interventions are beneficial or harmful, the results should be interpreted with caution, as they are based on only a small number of patients and are subject to a high risk of bias."
353, The use of antiglucocorticoids in the treatment of mood disorders is at the proof-of-concept stage. Considerable methodological differences exist between studies with respect to the compounds used and the patient cohorts studied. Results in some diagnostic subtypes are promising and warrant further investigation to establish the clinical utility of these drugs in the treatment of mood disorders.," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of antidepressants in the treatment of depression. Further research is needed to establish the effectiveness and safety of antidepressants for depression, and to compare the effectiveness of antidepressants with other antidepressants in terms of improvement in mood, cognition and function. Finally, to determine the efficacy of antidepressants as an adjunct to other antidepressants, future research should focus on the efficacy and safety aspects of antidepressants, as well as on their effectiveness in reducing depressive symptoms, and on improving mood."
354, There is not enough evidence to evaluate the use of nutrient therapy for suspected impaired fetal growth. The studies were too small to assess clinical outcomes adequately., There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of progestogen as a substitute for oxytocin in the treatment of IGF-I or IGF-II. Further randomized controlled trials are needed to determine whether progestogens are beneficial or harmful in improving fetal wellbeing and maternal wellbeing. Such trials should be undertaken in the context of a well-defined group of women who are at risk of developing IGF-1 deficiency or developing IGF2 deficiency. They should also include women who have been diagnosed with IGF-2 deficiency and those who do not have an IGF-3 deficiency.
355," There was no evidence to suggest a shortened fluid fast results in an increased risk of aspiration, regurgitation or related morbidity compared with the standard 'nil by mouth from midnight' fasting policy. Permitting patients to drink water preoperatively resulted in significantly lower gastric volumes. Clinicians should be encouraged to appraise this evidence for themselves and when necessary adjust any remaining standard fasting policies (nil-by-mouth from midnight) for patients that are not considered 'at-risk' during anaesthesia."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of alcohol as a substitute for tea or tea as an adjunct to tea in the treatment of gastric volume and pH imbalance in patients with anaesthesia. Further research is needed to determine the optimal ratio of alcohol and tea to tea and tea as a supplement to tea or water as a complement to tea. Finally, future research should evaluate the effects of alcohol on gastric volumes and pH in patients undergoing anaesthesia, as well as the effect of tea and water as an adjuvant to tea, and on the incidence of adverse effects, such as nausea and vomiting."
356, Further studies are needed to compare chemoradiation versus thermoradiation versus chemoradiation plus hyperthermia in well selected/conducted and quality controlled randomised trials.," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of hydrogel in the treatment of local tumour recurrence. Further research is needed to identify the optimal hydrogels and the optimal dose, duration and timing of hydogel in treating local tumours and to determine the optimal formulation and timing. The results of this review should be interpreted with caution, as the conclusions are based on a small number of small studies with a high risk of bias and are subject to change."
357," Squeezable bottles appear easier to use than rigid feeding bottles for babies born with clefts of the lip and/or palate, however, there is no evidence of a difference in growth outcomes between the bottle types. There is weak evidence that breastfeeding is better than spoon-feeding following surgery for cleft. There was no evidence to suggest that maxillary plates assist growth in babies with clefts of the palate. No evidence was found to assess the use of any types of maternal advice and/or support for these babies."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the existence of a difference in body mass, caloric intake, protein intake or protein intake between the two methods of measuring body mass and protein intake. Further research is needed to determine the best way to measure body mass in relation to protein intake, carbohydrate intake and protein intakes, as well as to assess the effects of protein intake on energy intake and caloric intake. Finally, future research should focus on measuring protein intake and carbohydrate intake, and on measuring energy intake, nutrient intake and nutrient intake."
358," The results of this review suggest that phakic IOLs are safer than excimer laser surgical correction for moderate to high myopia in the range of -6.0 to -20.0 D and phakic IOLs are preferred by patients. While phakic IOLs might be accepted clinical practice for higher levels of myopia (greater than or equal to 7.0 D of myopic spherical equivalent with or without astigmatism), it may be worth considering phakic IOL treatment over excimer laser correction for more moderate levels of myopia (less than or equal to 7.0 D of myopic spherical equivalent with or without astigmatism). Further RCTs adequately powered for subgroup analysis are necessary to further elucidate the ideal range of myopia for phakic IOLs."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of photocoagulation for spherical equivalent refractory vision correction. Further research is needed to identify the optimal photocoaggulation technique, the best way to achieve this, and the most effective photoagulation technique. Finally, there is a need for further evaluation of the effectiveness and safety aspects of photocagulation in spherical equivalent vision correction, as well as the effectiveness of phototherapy in spherical or spherical equivalent correction."
359," Infliximab 5 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg, given every 8 weeks, is effective for the maintenance of remission and maintenance of fistula healing in patients who have responded to infliximab induction therapy. Adalimumab 40 mg weekly or every other week is effective for the maintenance of remission in patients who have responded to adalimumab induction therapy. Certolizumab pegol 400 mg every 4 weeks is effective for the maintenance of remission in patients who have responded to certolizumab induction therapy. No comparative trials have evaluated the relative efficacy of these agents. Adverse events are similar in the infliximab, adalimumab, and certolizumab groups compared with placebo, but study size and duration generally are insufficient to allow an adequate assessment of serious adverse events associated with long-term use."," Infliximab is effective in maintaining remission in patients with Crohn's disease. Its efficacy is similar to that of infliximab, but with a lower incidence of adverse events. It is not clear whether it has an effect on the number of days lost to treatment or on the severity of the disease, but it is unlikely that it will have an impact on the quality of life of patients who are unable to tolerate it. It may have a beneficial effect on blood pressure, but its effects are not clear from this review. It should be noted that the data in this review are based on a small number of patients, and therefore the conclusions of this review should be interpreted cautiously."
360," This systematic review's findings show that integrated HIV/AIDS and MNCHN-FP services are feasible to implement and show promise towards improving a variety of health and behavioral outcomes. However, significant evidence gaps remain. Rigorous research comparing outcomes of integrated with non-integrated services, including cost, cost-effectiveness, and health outcomes such as HIV and STI incidence, morbidity and mortality are greatly needed to inform programs and policy."," The results of this review support the use of automated PCR kits to enhance the uptake of HIV testing in pregnant women and their partners. However, there is a need for further research into the effectiveness of such kits in improving the quality of testing and reducing attrition in the workforce. This is especially true in the context of the increasing prevalence of HIV infection in the developing world, where the prevalence of viral loads is high. Future research should focus on assessing the effectiveness and effectiveness of these kits, as well as assessing the cost-effectiveness of the kits, and also on the impact on maternal satisfaction with the kits."
361," Although there are shortcomings and gaps in the data, there appears to be enough overall consistency for different outcomes. The efficacy and adverse effects profile of penfluridol are similar to other typical antipsychotics; both oral and depot. Furthermore, penfluridol is shown to be an adequate treatment option for people with schizophrenia, especially those who do not respond to oral medication on a daily basis and do not adapt well to depot drugs. One of the results favouring penfluridol was a lower drop out rate in medium term when compared to depot medications. It is also an option for chronic sufferers of schizophrenia with residual psychotic symptoms who nevertheless need continuous use of antipsychotic medication. An additional benefit of penfluridol is that it is a low-cost intervention. Note: the eight citations in the awaiting classification section of the review may alter the conclusions of the review once assessed."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of benzodiazepines in the management of autonomic liability. Further research is needed to identify the optimal dose, duration and timing, and the best way to deliver benzodine to people with schizophrenia, and to evaluate the effectiveness of other types ofiazepines, and also to assess the efficacy and safety of other forms ofiazepine therapy. Finally, future research should evaluate the efficacy of other kinds ofiazepam therapy, as well as the effectiveness and safety aspects of these treatments."
362," Regimens for the acute phase of illness should contain ceftazidime or imipenem. It is not yet clear if combinations of treatments in the early phase reduce relapse. For oral therapy after the acute phase of treatment, trials suggest that conventional four drug regimens can be used for treatment."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of antibiotics in the treatment of melioidosis. Further research is needed to establish the effectiveness of antibiotic treatment in this population. It is also important to understand the mechanism by which antibiotic treatment differs from antibiotic treatment, as well as the mechanisms by which it differs from treatment in terms of duration of treatment and severity of mortality. Finally, there is a need for further research into the efficacy of antibiotic therapy in this group of patients, and also to compare antibiotic treatment with treatment with antibiotic treatment."
363," The potential benefit of antibiotics in the treatment of clinically diagnosed acute rhinosinusitis needs to be seen in the context of a high prevalence of adverse events. Taking into account antibiotic resistance and the very low incidence of serious complications, we conclude that there is no place for antibiotics for the patient with clinically diagnosed, uncomplicated acute rhinosinusitis. This review cannot make recommendations for children, patients with a suppressed immune system and patients with severe disease, as these populations were not included in the available trials."," There is no evidence to support the use of antibiotics in the treatment of purulent rhinorrhoea. However, there is a need for further research into the effectiveness of antibiotic therapy in this condition. In addition, there are concerns about potential side effects, such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, sleepiness, sleeplessness, fatigue, and sleeplessness. Further research is needed to determine the effectiveness and safety of antibiotics for this condition, as well as to compare antibiotic therapy with other treatments."
364," The findings of our work indicate that Polyethylene glycol is better than lactulose in outcomes of stool frequency per week, form of stool, relief of abdominal pain and the need for additional products. On subgroup analysis, this is seen in both adults and children, except for relief of abdominal pain. Polyethylene Glycol should be used in preference to Lactulose in the treatment of Chronic Constipation."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of hydrocortisone as an electrolyte solution for the treatment of hard stool formation. Further research is needed to identify the optimal hydrocORTisone formulation, the optimal electrolyte formulation, and the best electrolyte composition for the management of soft stool formation in people with hard stool drainage. Finally, there is a need for further research into the efficacy and toxicity profiles of various electrolyte solutions for soft stool drainage in people who are suffering hard constipation."
365," There was not enough evidence to judge whether or not the included drugs cured bedwetting when used alone. There was limited evidence to suggest that desmopressin, imipramine and enuresis alarms therapy were better than the included drugs to which they were compared. In other reviews, desmopressin, tricyclics and alarm interventions have been shown to be effective during treatment. There was also evidence to suggest that combination therapy with anticholinergic therapy increased the efficacy of other established therapies such as imipramine, desmopressin and enuresis alarms by reducing the relapse rates, by about 20%, although it was not possible to identify the characteristics of children who would benefit from combination therapy. Future studies should evaluate the role of combination therapy against established treatments in rigorous and adequately powered trials."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the effectiveness of hydrocolloid therapy in reducing the frequency of wet nights in humans with no known adverse effects. Further research is needed to determine the effectiveness and safety, and to assess the effectiveness, effectiveness, and effectiveness of these treatments in human beings with no apparent adverse effects on bladder capacity or bladder capacity. Finally, long-term data are needed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of hydroxyethylprednisolone in humans, as well as to assess its effectiveness in humans."
366, There is no evidence from good quality randomized trials or non-randomized studies of the effectiveness of lens extraction for chronic primary angle-closure glaucoma.," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of photocoagulation in the treatment of IOP. Further research is needed to determine the effectiveness of photoagulation for IOP, and to compare the effectiveness and safety of this technique with other methods of optical infiltration. Finally, there is a need for a meta-analysis of the efficacy and safety aspects of photocagulation, as well as to compare these methods with other techniques of optical infiltrators."
367," Massage might be beneficial for patients with subacute and chronic non-specific low-back pain, especially when combined with exercises and education. The evidence suggests that acupuncture massage is more effective than classic massage, but this need confirmation. More studies are needed to confirm these conclusions, to assess the impact of massage on return-to-work, and to determine cost-effectiveness of massage as an intervention for low-back pain."," Cognitive enhancers are effective in reducing pain intensity in people with chronic low-back pain, but are associated with a higher incidence of adverse effects, such as nausea, vomiting, sleepiness and sleepiness. Positive effects were found in patients with low pain intensity, but were not statistically significant in those with subacute pain intensity. Negative effects were observed in those receiving enhancers. Positive results were consistent with those seen in the previous version of this review, which was published in the same volume as the original edition. Positive findings were consistent in the assessment of pain intensity and function, and in those patients receiving enhancer therapy. Negative results were not reported in the original version of the review, but the new version has now been published in full. Positive conclusions from this review should be interpreted with caution, however, as the review was based on a small number of studies and therefore the conclusions of the original article are not necessarily the same."
368," Choice of therapy for second stage Gambiense HAT will continue to be determined by what is locally available, but eflornithine and NECT are likely to replace melarsoprol, with careful parasite resistance monitoring. We need research on reducing adverse effects of currently used drugs, testing different regimens, and experimental and clinical studies of new compounds, effective for both stages of the disease."," Melarsoprol is effective in reducing relapse rates and severity of adverse events, but its effectiveness is not clear. Its efficacy is similar to that of melarsoproprol, but with a higher incidence of adverse effects. Its effectiveness is comparable to that seen in the earlier version of this review. Its duration is longer, and its duration is shorter, but the severity of relapse is less clear. It is unlikely that the new version will have a similar efficacy as the older version."
369," Based on this analysis, the most prudent prescription for water intake to premature infants would seem to be careful restriction of water intake so that physiological needs are met without allowing significant dehydration. This practice could be expected to decrease the risks of patent ductus arteriosus and necrotizing enterocolitis without significantly increasing the risk of adverse consequences."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of hydrocortisone in the management of arteriosus in the treatment of vasopressin-induced hypoglycaemia. Further research is needed to identify the optimal hydrocORTisone formulation and dosage, and to assess the effectiveness of hydocortisones in this population. Finally, there is a need for further research into the effectiveness and safety of electrolyte supplements in this setting. Finally there is an urgent need for a well-designed, conducted and reported randomized controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety and effectiveness of various electrolyte formulations."
370," Implications for practice No trials were found addressing treatment of VVC in HIV positive women.In comparison to placebo,Fluconazole was found to be an effective preventative intervention. However, the potential for resistant Candida organisms to develop might impact the feasibility of implementation. Direction of findings suggests that Clotrimazole and Lactobacillus improved the prophylactic outcomes when compared to placebo. Implications for researchThere is a need to evaluate drugs and drug regimens for VVC treatment and prophylaxis in HIV positive women through randomised clinical trials. Development of resistance to azoles remains under-studied and more work must be done in this area, so as to determine whether routine prophylaxis for VVC is at all needed or whether adequate ART would be sufficient to prevent recurrent VVC. The viral load in vaginal secretions with or without treatment or prophylaxis has not been studied, this is very relevant to the spread of HIV."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of antiviral drugs in the treatment of candidiasis. Further randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm the effectiveness of antivirals in preventing candidiasis, and to assess the effects on other candidiasis types, such as oral antiviral agents, as well as to assess whether antiviral medications are more effective than antiviral treatments in reducing candidiasis severity and duration. Such trials are also needed to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of antivirus drugs in candidiasis and to compare antiviral therapies to antiviral ones."
371," Although statistically significant, the differences between disc replacement and conventional fusion surgery for degenerative disc disease were not beyond the generally accepted clinical important differences with respect to short-term pain relief, disability and Quality of Life. Moreover, these analyses only represent a highly selected population. The primary goal of prevention of adjacent level disease and facet joint degeneration by using total disc replacement, as noted by the manufacturers and distributors, was not properly assessed and not a research question at all. Unfortunately, evidence from observational studies could not be used because of the high risk of bias, while these could have improved external validity assessment of complications in less selected patient groups. Non-randomised studies should however be very clear about patient selection and should incorporate independent, blinded outcome assessment, which was not the case in the excluded studies. Therefore, because we believe that harm and complications may occur after years, we believe that the spine surgery community should be prudent about adopting this technology on a large scale, despite the fact that total disc replacement seems to be effective in treating low-back pain in selected patients, and in the short term is at least equivalent to fusion surgery."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the effectiveness of ergonomic screws for improving patient satisfaction with pain management and function in low-back pain. Further research is needed to determine whether ergonomic screw screws improve patient satisfaction or function in the short-term or long-term, and to compare ergonomic devices with other types of screws. Finally, to determine the effectiveness and safety of ergonomics for reducing patient satisfaction and function, a meta-analysis of the results of this review is warranted."
372, This update of the review published in 2004 incorporates additional trials and more mature data. It demonstrates the benefit of concurrent chemoradiation over radiotherapy alone or sequential chemoradiotherapy. Patient selection is an important consideration in view of the added toxicity of concurrent treatment. Uncertainty remains as to how far this is purely due to a radiosensitising effect and whether similar benefits could be achieved by using modern radiotherapy techniques and more dose intensive accelerated and/ or hyperfractionated radiotherapy regimens.," There is no evidence to support or refute the use of chemoradoxine as a substitute for cisplatin for radiotherapy in terms of overall survival and progression-free survival. However, there is a need for further research into chemoradiotherapy in this population. In particular, there are concerns about the impact on survival and quality of life, and the possibility of a relapse in patients with metastatic disease, which has been reported in the past."
373," Complex approaches show promise, with some persistence of abstinence (30 days point prevalence abstinence or continuous abstinence at six months), especially those incorporating elements sensitive to stage of change and using motivational enhancement and CBT. We await results of recent trials of Not on Tobacco trials and more data is needed on sustained quitting that allows for the episodic nature of much adolescent smoking. There were few trials with evidence about pharmacological interventions (nicotine replacement and bupropion), and none demonstrated effectiveness for adolescent smokers. There is not yet sufficient evidence to recommend widespread implementation of any one model. There continues to be a need for well-designed adequately powered randomized controlled trials of interventions for this population of smokers."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of any specific type of counselling for smoking cessation. Further research is needed to identify the most effective type and duration of counselling, and to compare the effectiveness and safety of counselling with other types of counselling. Finally, there is a need for further research into the effectiveness of psychological counselling for nicotine replacement therapy, as well as to compare psychological counselling with counselling alone or in combination with other forms of counselling and counselling."
374," The results suggest cell salvage is efficacious in reducing the need for allogeneic red cell transfusion in adult elective cardiac and orthopaedic surgery. The use of cell salvage did not appear to impact adversely on clinical outcomes. However, the methodological quality of trials was poor. As the trials were unblinded and lacked adequate concealment of treatment allocation, transfusion practices may have been influenced by knowledge of the patients' treatment status potentially biasing the results in favour of cell salvage."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of any of the interventions reviewed in this review. However, there is a need for further well-designed trials to evaluate the effectiveness of these interventions in terms of blood transfusion, blood loss, transfusion capacity, and transfusion efficiency. Importantly, these trials should be of high quality, with a focus on reducing blood loss and blood loss in patients undergoing transfusion and blood transfusions, rather than on transfusion duration."
375," There is significant evidence to suggest that topical application of chlorhexidine to umbilical cord reduces neonatal mortality and omphalitis in community and primary care settings in developing countries. It may increase cord separation time however, there is no evidence that it increases risk of subsequent morbidity or infection. There is insufficient evidence to support the application of an antiseptic to umbilical cord in hospital settings compared with dry cord care in developed countries."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of alcohol disinfection as an alternative to manual cord cleaning in the treatment of umbilical cord separation. Further research is needed to determine the best disinfection regimen, the best method of disinfection, and the most effective disinfection method. Further trials are also needed to assess the effectiveness of water disinfection in reducing cord separation time and to compare disinfection with manual cord cleansing. Finally, future trials should evaluate the effectiveness and safety of disinfecting cord cleaning as a complementary treatment to manual disinfection."
376," We found insufficient evidence to determine if overground physical therapy gait training benefits gait function in patients with chronic stroke, though limited evidence suggests small benefits for uni-dimensional variables such as gait speed or 6MWT. These findings must be replicated by large, high quality studies using varied outcome measures."," Walking speed and gait speed are similar to those measured in the Functional Balance Scale, but the difference in fitness is smaller. Walking speed is associated with a decreased risk of falls and falls, but is not associated with an increase in risk of falling. Running speed appears to have a beneficial effect on fitness, but there is no evidence of an improvement in fitness. Running Speed appears to be faster than walking speed or gait velocity, but this is not clear from this review. Running time is slower than treadmill speed. Running speeds appear to be slower in the short-term, but not in the long-term. Run time is faster in the intermediate-term and longer-term than in the shorter-term but the longer term results are still not clear. Running times are slower than walking time, but more accurate. Running distances are slower, but slower. Running distance is slower, and slower in shorter intervals, but faster in longer intervals. Running lengths are slower and faster in shorter periods, but are not as fast as treadmill speed or treadmill speed, or faster in slower periods, or longer periods. Running intervals are slower in slower-term runners than treadmill speeds, but shorter in shorter term runners. Run-time is slower in older runners than in younger runners. Running tests are faster in older people, but longer term data are still lacking. Running machines appear to have fewer adverse effects in younger people than treadmill time. Running shoes appear to improve speed and fitness in slower runners, but further research is needed to determine whether this is true for younger people or older people. Run tests are more likely to have an adverse impact on fitness and fitness, and are less likely to be carried out in older patients. Running test results are less consistent in younger and older people than in older adults, but results are more consistent in older and younger people, and in younger adults. Run test results should be interpreted with caution, however, as they are based on a small number of repetitions of"
377," CABG is associated with reduced rates of major adverse cardiac events, mostly driven by reduced repeat revascularisation. However, the RCT data are limited by follow-up, unrepresentative samples and rapid development of both surgical techniques and stenting. Research on real-world patient population or patient level data meta-analyses may identify risk factors and groupings who may benefit most from one strategy over the other."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of prophylactic stenting as an alternative to conventional stenting in patients with a proximal risk of death, or who are unable to tolerate stenting. Further research is needed to determine the optimal stenting technique, the optimal timing and duration of stenting, and the optimal duration of the stent procedure. Finally, future research should evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of anti-anginal drugs as alternatives to traditional stenting and replace stenting with antiplatelet agents, and to compare the effectiveness of these drugs in terms of reduced mortality."
378," Our review should provide some guidance to clinicians and patients. On the basis of high quality evidence, natalizumab and IFNß-1a (Rebif) are superior to all other treatments for preventing clinical relapses in RRMS in the short-term (24 months) compared to placebo. Moderate quality evidence supports a protective effect of natalizumab and IFNß-1a (Rebif) against disability progression in RRMS in the short-term compared to placebo. These treatments are associated with long-term serious adverse events and their benefit-risk balance might be unfavourable. IFNß-1b (Betaseron) and mitoxantrone probably decreased the odds of the participants with RRMS having relapses, compared with placebo (moderate quality of evidence). The benefit-risk balance with azathioprine is uncertain, however this agent might be effective in decreasing the odds of the participants with RRMS having relapses and disability progression over 24 to 36 months, compared with placebo. The lack of convincing efficacy data shows that IFNß-1a (Avonex), intravenous immunoglobulins, cyclophosphamide and long-term steroids have an unfavourable benefit-risk balance in RRMS. None of the included treatments are effective in decreasing disability progression in patients with progressive MS. It is important to consider that the clinical effects of all these treatments beyond two years are uncertain, a relevant point for a disease of 30 to 40 years duration. Direct head-to-head comparison(s) between natalizumab and IFNß-1a (Rebif) or between azathioprine and IFNß-1a (Rebif) should be top priority on the research agenda and follow-up of the trial cohorts should be mandatory."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of IL-2 inhibitors in the treatment of relapses in patients with relapses remitting or relapse-remitting MS. Further randomized controlled trials are needed to determine the optimal dose and duration of IL2 inhibitors, the optimal dosage, and the optimal duration of therapy in these patients. Finally, long-term data are required to evaluate the effectiveness of IL3 inhibitors in removing relapses and relapsing remitting and relapses, and to compare the effectiveness and safety of these drugs."
379," Carbamazepine is effective in chronic neuropathic pain, with caveats. No trial was longer than four weeks, of good reporting quality, using outcomes equivalent to at least moderate clinical benefit. In these circumstances, caution is needed in interpretation, and meaningful comparison with other interventions is not possible."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the effectiveness of acupuncture for the treatment of pain relief in neuralgia. Further research is needed to determine the effectiveness and safety of acupuncture, and to compare acupuncture with other forms of analgesic therapy for pain relief, and also to determine whether acupuncture is more effective than no treatment or no treatment at all. Finally, future trials should evaluate the efficacy of acupuncture compared to no treatment, and should include participants with a history of pain disorders."
380, Limited data from small studies using neuroleptic reduction or specific neuroleptic drugs as treatments for TD did not provide any convincing evidence of the value of these approaches. There is a need for larger trials of a longer duration in order to fully investigate this area.," Prolactin is an effective treatment for people with schizophrenia who are struggling with relapse. Its use is associated with a reduction in relapse severity and a decreased risk of relapse, but its use is not associated with an improvement in quality of life. It is not clear whether it has an effect on relapse severity or severity. Its efficacy is unclear due to the rarity of the disorder and the fact that the majority of patients relapse within a few weeks of treatment. Its adverse effects are usually mild and mild and its duration is short-lived."
381," Magnesium sulphate more than halves the risk of eclampsia, and probably reduces maternal death. There is no clear effect on outcome after discharge from hospital. A quarter of women report side effects with magnesium sulphate."," There is insufficient evidence to recommend magnesium sulphate as an adjunct to oxytocin in the treatment of eclampsia. Further research is needed to determine the optimal dose, duration and timing of treatment, as well as the best dose and duration of treatment. Finally, there is a need for further research into the effects of magnesium sulphates on maternal and neonatal mortality and maternal morbidity, and to compare the effects on maternal or neonatal death and maternal health."
382," Early intervention programmes for preterm infants have a positive influence on cognitive and motor outcomes during infancy, with the cognitive benefits persisting into pre-school age. There is a great deal of heterogeneity between studies due to the variety of early developmental intervention programmes trialled and gestational ages of the preterm infants included, which limits the comparisons of intervention programmes. Further research is needed to determine which early developmental interventions are the most effective at improving cognitive and motor outcomes, and on the longer-term effects of these programmes."," Cognitive enhancers are effective in enhancing cognitive performance and enhancing caregiver-related skills. Positive effects on caregiver performance were observed in the control group, but the results were not statistically significant in the comparison group. Positive results were found in the cognitive enhancers group, which were not significantly different from the control groups. Positive findings were found for cognitive enhancer therapy, which was associated with a significant improvement in cognitive performance. Cognitive enharmaceutical therapy is effective in improving cognitive enharmancy in the assessment of caregiver skills and enhancing social functioning. Positive conclusions were also found for psychological enharmour therapy, but these conclusions are based on a small number of studies with short-term follow-up and are not necessarily representative of the whole range of developmental enharmours evaluated in this review. Further research is needed to assess the effects of enharmOUR therapy on social functioning and developmental outcomes, as well as for developmental outcomes such as language development, social functioning, cognitive functioning, language comprehension and social functioning in the developmental group."
383," In order to eliminate potential selection bias, more RCTs need to be conducted in this area so that effectiveness, as well as efficacy, can be ascertained. The interlock programme appears to be effective while the device is installed in the vehicle of the offender. Studies need to address ways of improving recidivism rates in the long term, as the major challenges are participation rates, compliance and durability."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the effectiveness of alcohol diversion programmes in reducing alcohol diversion rates. Further research is needed to determine the effectiveness and safety of these programmes and to compare them with other types of diversion programmes, such as alcohol diversion programs, and to assess the effects of these interventions on alcohol diversion. Finally, there is a need for a well-designed, well-conducted and executed randomised controlled trial to evaluate the effectiveness, safety and effectiveness of these programs. Such a trial is warranted."
384," A single dose of paracetamol provides effective analgesia for about half of patients with acute postoperative pain, for a period of about four hours, and is associated with few, mainly mild, adverse events."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of ibuprofen as an adjunct to standard analgesia in the treatment of acute pain, or to support its use as a substitute for standard analgesic therapy in patients with acute pain. Further research is needed to determine the optimal dose, duration and duration, and the optimal dosage, duration, duration of treatment, and duration of therapy in these patients. Finally, future research should evaluate the efficacy and safety of other analgesic therapies, and also assess the effectiveness of other types of analgesia, such as oral opioids, and other analgesics."
385," The results of this review give some support to ciclesonide as an equivalent therapy to other ICS at similar nominal doses. The studies assessed low doses of steroids, in patients whose asthma required treatment with low doses of steroids. At half the dose of FP and BDP/BUD, the effects of ciclesonide were more inconsistent The effect on candidiasis may be of importance to people who find this to be problematic. The role of ciclesonide in the management of asthma requires further study, especially in paediatric patients. Further assessment against FP at a dose ratio of 1:2 is a priority."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of corticosteroids in the treatment of people with chronic lung disease. There is a need for further well-designed, well-conducted and reported randomized controlled trials to evaluate the efficacy and safety of these medications in the management of these patients. Finally, there is an urgent need for a standardised assessment of the effectiveness of corticoagulants in the control of chronic lung diseases, including those with asthma who have a history of exacerbations requiring rescue medication."
386, Both TCAs and SSRIs are effective for depression treated in primary care.," There is insufficient evidence to recommend sertraline for the treatment of depression in people with depression. Further research is needed to identify the best antidepressant for depression in a population with a history of depressive symptoms and to assess its efficacy in a broader range of conditions, including depression severity, quality of life, psychological wellbeing and psychological wellbeing. Finally, there is a need for further research into the efficacy and effectiveness of other antidepressants in depression patients with depression and anxiety disorders, as well as to assess the effectiveness and safety of antidepressants in this population."
387," No effect was shown for specific outcomes: laboratory-proven influenza, pneumonia and death from pneumonia. An effect was shown for the non-specific outcomes of ILI, GP consultations for ILI and all-cause mortality in individuals ≥ 60. These non-specific outcomes are difficult to interpret because ILI includes many pathogens, and winter influenza contributes < 10% to all-cause mortality in individuals ≥ 60. The key interest is preventing laboratory-proven influenza in individuals ≥ 60, pneumonia and deaths from pneumonia, and we cannot draw such conclusions. The identified studies are at high risk of bias. Some HCWs remain unvaccinated because they do not perceive risk, doubt vaccine efficacy and are concerned about side effects. This review did not find information on co-interventions with HCW vaccination: hand washing, face masks, early detection of laboratory-proven influenza, quarantine, avoiding admissions, anti-virals, and asking HCWs with ILI not to work. We conclude there is no evidence that vaccinating HCWs prevents influenza in elderly residents in LTCFs. High quality RCTs are required to avoid risks of bias in methodology and conduct, and to test these interventions in combination."," Influenza vaccination is effective in reducing mortality in healthcare staff and reducing hospitalizations in patients with ILI. However, there is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of influenza vaccination for ILI or ILI in health care staff. Further research is needed to determine the effectiveness and safety of flu vaccination and to assess the effectiveness of flu vaccines in ILI and ILI patients, and to compare influenza vaccination with other preventive measures, such as antibiotic use and duration of hospitalisation. Finally, future research should focus on assessing the effects of influenza vaccines on ILI mortality, and on improving the quality of the evidence base."
388, There is no evidence to suggest that spinal manipulation is effective in the treatment of dysmenorrhoea. In the one trial reporting on adverse effects there was no greater risk of such events with spinal compared with sham manipulation.," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of VAS in the treatment of menorrhoea. Further research is needed to determine whether VAS is beneficial or harmful, and to compare VAS with other methods of progestogen suppression, and also to determine the effectiveness of VASS in the management of these conditions. Finally, to determine if VAS has a beneficial effect on the quality of life of these women, a randomized controlled trial is needed. Such a trial is also needed."
389," We found evidence, of moderate quality, that radiation decreases the risk of disease progression compared with no further treatment, but little evidence that it might improve overall survival, in stage IB cervical cancer. The evidence on serious adverse events was equivocal."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of progestogens in the treatment of recurrence-free interval. Further randomized controlled trials are needed to determine whether progestogen is beneficial or harmful for survival or progression free interval in patients with recurrence free interval. Such trials are also needed to evaluate the effects of progesterone on overall survival and progression free survival, and to assess the impact on survival and quality of life in these patients. These trials should also assess the effects on progression-free survival and survival in these individuals."
390, The administration of GnRH agonists for a period of three to six months prior to IVF or ICSI in women with endometriosis increases the odds of clinical pregnancy by fourfold. Data regarding adverse effects of this therapy on the mother or fetus are not available at present.," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of progestogen as a substitute for oocyte retrieval in preclinical pregnancy. Further research is needed to determine the optimal dose and duration of progesterone as a complement to oocyte retrievals, and to compare progestogens with oocyte extraction as an adjuvant strategy. Finally, there is a need for a meta-analysis of data on the effectiveness and safety of progesta gel as a replacement for oocytes retrieval as part of the standard protocol for preclinical pregnancies."
391," The value of the various approaches to conservative management of postprostatectomy incontinence after radical prostatectomy remains uncertain. It seems unlikely that men benefit from one-to-one pelvic floor muscle training therapy after transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP). Long-term incontinence may be managed by external penile clamp, but there are safety problems."," There is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of any particular type of pad test in the treatment of urinary excretion. Further research is needed to determine the optimal pad test for this purpose and to compare the effectiveness of various types of pad tests in terms of accuracy, reliability, accuracy, accuracy and reliability of results. Finally, future research should focus on assessing the effects of different types of pads on quality of life and quantity of urine excretion, as well as assessing the effectiveness and durability of the pads, and also on the durability of urine retention."
392, There is no reliable evidence from randomised controlled trials to support the effectiveness of haemostatic drugs in reducing mortality or disability in patients with TBI. New randomised controlled trials assessing the effects of haemostatic drugs in TBI patients should be conducted. These trials should be large enough to detect clinically plausible treatment effects.," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of TICH as a diagnostic tool in the treatment of thromboembolic complications in cystic fibrosis. Further research is needed to determine the best way to implement TICH. The results of this review should be interpreted with caution, however, because of the rarity of the cases and the lack of reporting of adverse events in most of the included studies, and the fact that the majority of the published reports were published in the United Kingdom, the results should be viewed with caution."
393, There were insufficient data to establish whether oral EPA was better than placebo. Comparisons of EPA combined with a protein energy supplementation versus a protein energy supplementation (without EPA) in the presence of an appetite stimulant (Megestrol Acetate) provided no evidence that EPA improves symptoms associated with the cachexia syndrome often seen in patients with advanced cancer.," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of dietary lipolysis for weight loss in patients with cancer. Further randomized controlled trials are needed to determine the effects of lipidolysis on quality of life and survival. Such trials are also needed to assess the effects on other important outcomes, such as progression to terminal cancer, progression to senorrhoea, and progression to metastatic cancer. Finally, long-term data are required to determine whether lipidolytics are beneficial or harmful for the treatment of cancer-related complications."
394," One study suggested that topical ketanserin is more effective than clioquinol cream or zinc paste. Topical phenytoin (two studies) may be more effective than saline dressing regarding ulcer healing. For the other dressings the results were equivocal. Canvas shoes were a little better than PVC-boots, but not significantly, and the effect of double rocker shoes compared to below-knee plasters was no different in promoting the healing of ulcers. No side effects were documented. There is a lack of high quality research in the field of ulcer prevention and treatment in leprosy. New trials should follow the current standards for design and reporting of randomised controlled trials."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of any of the methods used in this review. Further research is needed to determine the effectiveness and safety of various methods of cleansing ulcer tissue, and to compare the effectiveness of various types of cleansing and cleansing agents, as well as to assess the efficacy of various cleansing agents in ulcer areas. Finally, there is a need for a well-designed, well-conducted and reported randomised controlled trial to evaluate the effects of cleansing agents on ulcer area healing and healing."
395," Based on two small trials, there was no significant difference in pain relief in women receiving oral analgesics compared with placebo or no treatment (129 women; MD -3.51; 95% CI -10.03 to 3.01). We consider this evidence to be of a low to moderate quality. In routine clinical practice, intracervical injection of local anaesthetic with a vasoconstrictor (lignocaine plus adrenaline or prilocaine plus felypressin) appears to be the optimum analgesia for treatment. However, further high-quality, adequately powered trials should be undertaken in order to provide the data necessary to estimate the efficacy of oral analgesics, the optimal route of administration and dose of local anaesthetics."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the effectiveness of acupuncture for pain relief in adults undergoing elective cervical surgery. Further research is needed to determine the effectiveness and safety of acupuncture, and to compare acupuncture with other analgesics, and also to assess the efficacy of acupuncture in children. Finally, there is a need for a well-designed, well-conducted and executed randomised controlled trial comparing acupuncture to other analgesic treatments, and comparing acupuncture with a non-surgical treatment."
396," The finding that healing rates can be higher for cases treated surgically as compared to those treated non-surgically, at least in the short term, is based on two RCTs only. A single RCT reported that in the medium to long term healing rates for the two procedures are very similar. There is currently scarce evidence for a sound decision making process among alternative treatments for the re-treatment of a periradicular pathosis. More well-designed RCTs should be performed with follow up of at least 4 years, and with a consistent sample size, to detect a true difference in the long term between the outcomes of the two alternative treatments, if any exist."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the existence of a mechanism of indirect compensation for pain relief in postoperative pain relief. Further research is needed to identify the mechanism by which indirect compensation relates to pain relief, function, satisfaction, satisfaction with pain relief and satisfaction with treatment, and to compare the effectiveness of these interventions with other forms of pain relief (such as relaxation, relaxation, restlessness, relaxation). Finally, there is a need for a well-designed, well-conducted and reported systematic review of the effectiveness and effectiveness of external compensation for postoperative discomfort. Such a review is warranted."
397," Studies evaluated in this review report significant improvements in knowledge measures and protective behaviours. Results might have differed had the true ICCs from studies been available or cluster-adjusted results been available. Several studies reported harms, suggesting a need to monitor the impact of similar interventions. Retention of knowledge should be measured beyond 3-12 months. Further investigation of the best forms of presentation and optimal age of programme delivery is required."," Knowledge of language skills is a valuable tool in the development of interpersonal skills. However, there is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of this tool as a standalone tool for interpersonal skills training. Further research is needed to assess the effectiveness of this intervention in relation to language skills training and interpersonal skills skills training, as well as to assess its effectiveness in the treatment of coercive behaviours. Future research should focus on improving the quality and consistency of knowledge and skills training exercises. Research is also needed to evaluate the effectiveness and reliability of verbal skills training as a component of workplace skills training programmes."
398," We do not know whether PQ added to treatment regimens for patients with P. falciparum infection reduces transmission of malaria. In individual patients, it reduces gametocyte prevalence and density. In practical terms, even if PQ results in large reductions in gametocytes in people being treated for malaria, there is no reliable evidence that this will reduce transmission in a malaria-endemic community, where many people are infected but have no symptoms and are unlikely to be treated. Since PQ is acting as a monotherapy against gametocytes, there is a risk of the parasite developing resistance to the drug. In terms of harms, there is insufficient evidence from trials to know whether the drug can be used safely in this way in populations where G6PD deficiency occurs. In light of these doubts about safety, and lack of evidence of any benefit in reducing transmission, countries should question whether to continue to use PQ routinely in primary treatment of malaria. Further synthesis of observational data on safety and new trials may help elucidate a role for PQ in malaria elimination, or in situations where most infected individuals are symptomatic and receive treatment."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of SP monotherapy for the treatment of P. falciparum. Further research is needed to determine the optimal monotherapy, the optimal dose, and the optimal duration of treatment. Finally, there is a need for further research into the efficacy and effectiveness of PR monotherapy in reducing the risk of relapse and relapse in patients with malaria, as well as to compare the effectiveness of SP and SP monotherapies in reducing relapse."
399," The data from five trials comparing differing washout policies were sparse and trials were generally of poor quality or poorly reported. The evidence was too scanty to conclude whether or not washouts were beneficial. In the first instance we require further rigorous, high quality trials with adequate power to detect any benefit from washout being performed as opposed to none. Then trials comparing different washout solutions, washout volumes, frequencies/timings and routes of administration are needed."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of antibiotics in the treatment of urinary incontinence. Further research is needed to determine the effectiveness of antibiotic treatment in the management of UTI, and to compare antibiotic treatment with no treatment or no treatment. Finally, there is a need for a well-designed, well-conducted and reported randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effectiveness and effectiveness of antibiotics for UTI in humans with antibiotic-resistant bacteria, and also to compare antibiotics with antibiotic treatment."
400," Despite collating more event data than previous systematic reviews of randomised controlled trials (665 deaths in some 6,250 participants), there is still insufficient power to exclude clinically important effects of reduced dietary salt on mortality or cardiovascular morbidity in normotensive or hypertensive populations. Our estimates of benefits from dietary salt restriction are consistent with the predicted small effects on clinical events attributable to the small blood pressure reduction achieved."," Reduced sodium intake is associated with a reduction in blood pressure and blood pressure, but there is no evidence of an effect on mortality or cardiovascular morbidity. Reduction in sodium intake does not appear to have a significant effect on blood pressure or blood pressure. However, there is a need for further well-designed randomized controlled trials to evaluate the effects of reducing sodium intake on mortality and cardiovascular morbidities and morbidity, and to compare sodium intake with sodium intake. Finally, a randomized controlled trial of sodium intake versus sodium intake will be needed to determine whether sodium intake affects mortality or morbidity and mortality."
401, From the limited results it is unclear whether the wearing of surgical face masks by members of the surgical team has any impact on surgical wound infection rates for patients undergoing clean surgery.," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the existence of a correlation between surgical site infection rates and surgical site infections. Further research is needed to determine the effectiveness of surgical site disinfection and disinfection in terms of reducing the incidence of post-operative infections and the severity of infection, and to compare the effectiveness and effectiveness of disinfection with other types of surgical sites disinfection or disinfection, and also to compare disinfection versus disinfection alone or in combination."
402," Cytisine increases the chances of quitting, although absolute quit rates were modest in two recent trials. Varenicline at standard dose increased the chances of successful long-term smoking cessation between two- and threefold compared with pharmacologically unassisted quit attempts. Lower dose regimens also conferred benefits for cessation, while reducing the incidence of adverse events. More participants quit successfully with varenicline than with bupropion. Two open-label trials of varenicline versus NRT suggested a modest benefit of varenicline but confidence intervals did not rule out equivalence. Limited evidence suggests that varenicline may have a role to play in relapse prevention. The main adverse effect of varenicline is nausea, but mostly at mild to moderate levels and tending to subside over time. Possible links with serious adverse events, including serious psychiatric or cardiovascular events, cannot be ruled out. Future trials of cytisine may test extended regimens and more intensive behavioural support. There is a need for further trials of the efficacy of varenicline treatment extended beyond 12 weeks."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the effectiveness of nicotine replacement therapy for the treatment of nicotine dependence in people with a history of smoking cessation. Nicotine replacement therapy appears to be effective in reducing nicotine dependence, but its effectiveness is not clear in patients who are already taking it. The results of this review suggest that nicotine replacement may be a viable option for those smokers who are willing to take it. However, this conclusion is based on a small number of studies with a high risk of bias and a lack of reporting of adverse events. Further research is needed to determine the effectiveness and safety of this treatment."
403," There was evidence from three pooled RCTs that ASA significantly reduces the recurrence of sporadic adenomatous polyps after one to three years. There is evidence from short-term studies to support regression, but not elimination or prevention of CRAs in FAP."," There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of sulphosphonates in the treatment of people with a polyp-bearing polyp. Further research is needed to determine the optimal dose, duration and timing of treatment and to assess the effectiveness of these agents in reducing the incidence of polypbearing polyps. Finally, there is a need for further research into the efficacy and safety of suturing agents in polyp bearing polyps, as well as to evaluate the effectiveness and durability of suture products."
404," Antibiotic prophylaxis is effective in preventing infectious complications following TRPB. There is no definitive data to confirm that antibiotics for long-course (3 days) are superior to short-course treatments (1 day), or that multiple-dose treatment is superior to single-dose."," Antibiotic prophylaxis is effective in reducing the incidence and severity of TPB, but it is not clear whether it has a beneficial effect on the incidence or severity of infectious complications, or on the severity of the infection. Antibiotics do not appear to have a significant effect on incidence of bacterial contamination, but they do appear to be beneficial in reducing bacterial contamination in the urine and blood stream. However, there is a need for further research into the effectiveness of antibiotics in TPB and in the treatment of infectious conditions."
405," There is not enough evidence to recommend any intervention for preventing excessive weight gain during pregnancy, due to the significant methodological limitations of included studies and the small observed effect sizes. More high-quality randomised controlled trials with adequate sample sizes are required to evaluate the effectiveness of potential interventions."," Dietary carbohydrate intake during pregnancy is associated with a reduction in maternal weight gain, a decrease in maternal hunger and a decrease of maternal hunger. However, there is no clear evidence of an effect on maternal hunger or maternal hunger on maternal wellbeing or maternal wellbeing. Dietary carbohydrate intakes are associated with an increased risk of developing hypoglycaemia, a decreased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and an increase in maternal thirst and thirst. Dietary carbohydrates are also associated with decreased maternal hunger, but there is insufficient evidence to recommend dietary carbohydrate intake as a substitute for dietary fibre intake. Dietary fiber intake should be considered as an adjunct to dietary fiber intake in the treatment of pre-partum weight gain."
