of unilateral refractive amblyopia it appears that there is a treatment benefit from refractive correction alone. where amblyopia persists there is evidence that adding occlusion further improves vision. despite advances in the understanding of the treatment of amblyopia it is currently still not possible to tailor individual treatment plans for amblyopia. the nature of any dose/response

difference in response rate or survival between the dexrazoxane and control groups was identified. the evidence available did not allow us to reach any definite conclusions about adverse effects. we conclude that if the risk of cardiac damage is expected to be high it might be justified to use dexrazoxane in patients with cancer treated with anthracyclines. however clinicians should weigh the cardioprotective effect of dexrazoxane against the possible risk of adverse effects for each individual patient.

cbz to be associated with fewer adverse events when compared to ir cbz. a change to cr cbz may therefore be a worthwhile strategy in patients with acceptable seizure control on ir cbz but experiencing unacceptable adverse events. the included trials were of small size poor methodological quality and possessed a high risk of bias limiting the validity of this conclusion. randomised controlled trials comparing cr cbz to ir cbz and using clinically relevant outcomes are required to inform the choice of cbz preparation for patients with newly diagnosed epilepsy.

increase effective prescribing can improve clinical outcome. this update provides more evidence about unintended clinical consequences of interventions and about the effect of interventions to reduce exposure of patients to antibiotics. the meta-analysis supports the use of restrictive interventions when the need is urgent but suggests that persuasive and restrictive interventions are equally effective after six months.

preterm labour with intact membranes on neonatal outcomes and raises concerns about increased neonatal mortality for those who received antibiotics. this treatment cannot therefore be currently recommended for routine practice. further research may be justified when sensitive markers for subclinical infection become available in order to determine if there is a subgroup of women who could experience benefit from antibiotic treatment for preterm labour prior to membrane rupture and to identify which antibiotic or combination of antibiotics is most effective. note the 17 citations in the awaiting classification section of the review may alter the conclusions of the review once assessed.

results there is no evidence from randomised controlled trials to indicate any benefit of zinc supplementation with regards to serum zinc level in patients with thalassaemia. however height velocity was noted to increase among those who received this intervention. there is mixed evidence on the benefit of using zinc supplementation in people with sickle cell disease. for instance there is evidence that zinc supplementation for one year increased the serum zinc levels in patients with sickle cell disease. however though serum zinc level was raised in patients receiving zinc supplementation haemoglobin level and anthropometry measurements were not significantly different between groups. evidence of benefit is seen with the reduction in the number of sickle cell crises among sickle cell patients who received one year of zinc sulphate supplementation and with the reduction in the total number of clinical infections among sickle cell patients who received zinc supplementation for both three months and for one year. the conclusion is based on the data from a small group of trials,which were generally of good quality with a low risk of bias. the authors recommend that more trials on zinc supplementation in thalassaemia and sickle cell disease be conducted given that the literature has shown the benefits of zinc in these types of diseases."

improvement in limb survival.

corticosteroids. on the other hand inhaled corticosteroid therapy shows a small advantage over long-acting beta-agonist therapy in terms of health-related quality of life but inhaled corticosteroids also increase the risk of pneumonia. this review supports current guidelines advocating long-acting beta-agonists as frontline therapy for copd with regular inhaled corticosteroid therapy as an adjunct in patients experiencing frequent exacerbations.

communication and decision aids have a variable effect on length of consultation. consistent with findings from the previous review which had included studies up to 2006 decision aids increase people's involvement and improve knowledge and realistic perception of outcomes however the size of the effect varies across studies. decision aids have a variable effect on choices. they reduce the choice of discretionary surgery and have no apparent adverse effects on health outcomes or satisfaction. the effects on adherence with the chosen option patient-practitioner communication cost-effectiveness and use with developing and/or lower literacy populations need further evaluation. little is known about the degree of detail that decision aids need in order to have positive effects on attributes of the decision or decision-making process.

into question the superiority of ics/laba over laba alone in preventing exacerbations. the effects on hospitalisations were inconsistent and require further exploration. there was moderate quality evidence of an increased risk of pneumonia with ics/laba. there was moderate quality evidence that treatments had similar effects on mortality. quality of life symptoms score rescue medication use and fev1 improved more on ics/laba than on laba but the average differences were probably not clinically significant for these outcomes. to an individual patient the increased risk of pneumonia needs to be balanced against the possible reduction in exacerbations. more information would be useful on the relative benefits and adverse event rates with combination inhalers using different doses of inhaled corticosteroids. evidence from head-to-head comparisons is needed to assess the comparative risks and benefits of the different combination inhalers.

mesalamine 1 to 2 g/day are not superior to placebo. high dose mesalamine 3 to 4.5 g/day is not more effective than placebo for inducing response or remission. high dose mesalamine was inferior to budesonide for inducing remission in a single trial. in conclusion sulfasalazine shows modest efficacy for the treatment of active crohn's disease. however the existing data show little benefit for 5-aminosalicylates.

hrqol domains including cancer-specific concerns e.g. breast cancer body image/self-esteem emotional well-being sexuality sleep disturbance social functioning anxiety fatigue and pain at varying follow-up periods. the positive results must be interpreted cautiously due to the heterogeneity of exercise programs tested and measures used to assess hrqol and hrqol domains and the risk of bias in many trials. further research is required to investigate how to sustain positive effects of exercise over time and to determine essential attributes of exercise mode intensity frequency duration timing by cancer type and cancer treatment for optimal effects on hrqol and its domains.

estrogen due to medical conditions.

based on odds ratios calculated from single trials most of which have very broad 95 confidence intervals because of small to modest sample sizes. the findings may not be wholly generalisable to primary care for a variety of reasons only two of the 19 trials included in the review were conducted in a primary care population setting and in 11 of the 19 trials ear cleaning formed part of the treatment an intervention unlikely to be available in primary care). despite these reservations some meaningful conclusions can be drawn from the evidence available topical treatments alone as distinct from systemic ones are effective for uncomplicated acute otitis externa. in most cases the choice of topical intervention does not appear to influence the therapeutic outcome significantly. any observed differences in efficacy were usually minor and not consistently present at each follow-up visit. acetic acid was effective and comparable to antibiotic/steroid at week 1. however when treatment needed to be extended beyond this point it was less effective. in addition patient symptoms lasted two days longer in the acetic acid group compared to antibiotic/steroid. the evidence for steroid-only drops is very limited and as yet not robust enough to allow us to reach a conclusion or provide recommendations. further investigation is needed. given that most topical treatments are equally effective it would appear that in most cases the preferred choice of topical treatment may be determined by other factors such as risk of ototoxicity risk of contact sensitivity risk of developing resistance availability cost and dosing schedule. factors such as speed of healing and pain relief are yet to be determined for many topical treatments and may also influence this decision. patients prescribed antibiotic/steroid drops can expect their symptoms to last for approximately six days after treatment has begun. although patients are usually treated with topical medication for seven to 10 days it is apparent that this will undertreat some patients and overtreat others. it may be more useful when prescribing ear drops to instruct patients to use them for at least a week. if they have symptoms beyond the first week they should continue the drops until their symptoms resolve and possibly for a few days after for a maximum of a further seven days. patients with persisting symptoms beyond two weeks should be considered treatment failures and alternative management initiated.

hormone therapy in similarly aged women was associated with a decrement in a number of verbal memory tests and a small improvement in a test of figural memory. there is insufficient evidence to determine whether subgroups of women using specific types of hormone therapy could benefit from treatment. it remains to be determined whether factors such as younger age 60 years of age type of menopause surgical or natural and type of treatment type of estrogen with or without a progestagen mode of delivery transdermal oral or intramuscular and dosage have positive effects at a clinically relevant level. in addition whether the absence or presence of menopausal symptoms can modify treatment effects should be investigated in more detail. large rcts currently underway in the usa may be able to provide answers to these uncertainties by the year 2010. in the meantime based on the available evidence ert or hrt cannot be recommended for overall cognitive improvement or maintenance in older postmenopausal women without cognitive impairment.

systematic review did not demonstrate any significant benefit of off-pump compared with on-pump cabg regarding mortality stroke or myocardial infarction. in contrast we observed better long-term survival in the group of patients undergoing on-pump cabg with the use of cardiopulmonary bypass and cardioplegic arrest. based on the current evidence on-pump cabg should continue to be the standard surgical treatment. however off-pump cabg may be acceptable when there are contraindications for cannulation of the aorta and cardiopulmonary bypass. further randomised clinical trials should address the optimal treatment in such patients.

haloperidol to counter the damaging and potentially dangerous consequences of untreated schizophrenia is justified. however where a choice of drug is available people with schizophrenia and clinicians may wish to prescribe an alternative antipsychotic with less likelihood of adverse effects such as parkinsonism akathisia and acute dystonias. haloperidol should not be a control drug of choice for randomised trials of new antipsychotics.

depression. no differences in terms of efficacy were found even though duloxetine was worse than some ssris most of all escitalopram and newer antidepressants like venlafaxine in terms of acceptability and tolerability. unfortunately we only found evidence comparing duloxetine with a handful of other active antidepressive agents and only a few trials per comparison were found in some cases we retrieved just one trial). this limited the power of the review to detect moderate but clinically meaningful differences between the drugs. as many statistical tests have been used in the review the findings from this review are better thought of as hypothesis forming rather than hypothesis testing and it would be very comforting to see the conclusions replicated in future trials. most of included studies were sponsored by the drug industry manufacturing duloxetine. as for all other new investigational compounds the potential for overestimation of treatment effect due to sponsorship bias should be borne in mind. in the present review no trials reported economic outcomes. given that several ssris and the great majority of antidepressants are now available as generic formulation only escitalopram desvenlafaxine and duloxetine are still on patent more comprehensive economic estimates of antidepressant treatment effect should be considered to better inform healthcare policy.

optimal dose could not be identified due to inconsistency in effective sucrose dosage among studies. further investigation on repeated administration of sucrose in neonates and the use of sucrose in combination with other non-pharmacological and pharmacological interventions is needed. sucrose use in extremely preterm unstable ventilated or a combination of these neonates needs to be addressed. additional research is needed to determine the minimally effective dose of sucrose during a single painful procedure and the effect of repeated sucrose administration on immediate pain intensity and long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes.

methods are available. combined regimens are more effective than single agents. in the combined regimen the dose of mifepristone can be lowered to 200 mg without significantly decreasing the method effectiveness. vaginal misoprostol is more effective than oral administration and has less side effects than sublingual or buccal. some results are limited by the small numbers of participants on which they are based. almost all trials were conducted in settings with good access to emergency services which may limit the generalizability of these results.

finding that placebo saline injection was followed by a similar symptomatic improvement to bulking agent injection raises questions about the mechanism of any beneficial effects. one small trial comparing silicone particles with pelvic floor muscle training was suggestive of benefit at three months but it is not known if this was sustained and the treatment was associated with high levels of postoperative retention and dysuria. greater symptomatic improvement was observed with surgical treatments though the advantages need to be set against likely higher risks. no clear-cut conclusions could be drawn from trials comparing alternative agents although dextranomer hyaluronic acid was associated with more local side effects and is no longer commercially available for this indication. there is insufficient evidence to show superiority of mid-urethral or bladder neck injection. the single trial of autologous fat provides a reminder that periurethral injections can occasionally cause

and tolerability between fluoxetine and certain ads but the clinical meaning of these differences is uncertain and no definitive implications for clinical practice can be drawn. from a clinical point of view the analysis of antidepressants safety profile adverse effect and suicide risk remains of crucial importance and more reliable data about these outcomes are needed. waiting for more robust evidence treatment decisions should be based on considerations of clinical history drug toxicity patient acceptability and cost. we need for large pragmatic trials enrolling heterogeneous populations of patients with depression to generate clinically relevant information on the benefits and harms of competitive pharmacological options. a meta-analysis of individual patient data from the randomised trials is clearly necessary.

mortality and complications in this patient population. at worst it can be harmful especially when administered later than 24 hours after the onset of symptoms by causing cardiovascular depression. unless future rcts provide evidence of treatment effect clinicians should not routinely use intravenous n-acetylcysteine in sirs or sepsis and academics should not promote its use.

trials in this review there is no evidence that one steroid is any more effective than another. there is weak evidence that aloe vera may reduce the pain of olp and improve the clinical signs of disease compared to placebo. there is weak and unreliable evidence that cyclosporin may reduce pain and clinical signs of olp. there is no evidence that other calcineurin inhibitors reduce pain compared to either steroids or placebo. from the 28 trials included in this systematic review the wide range of interventions compared means there is insufficient evidence to support the effectiveness of any specific treatment as being superior.

are based on data from 1422 patients included in 10 trials. results from ongoing or new trials are required to determine if there are clinically important differences in bleeding risk between pathogen-reduced platelet transfusions and standard platelet transfusions. given the variability in trial design bleeding assessment and quality of outcome reporting it is recommended that future trials apply standardised approaches to outcome assessment and follow-up including safety reporting.

implications for practicedue to there being only one study in children it is not possible to make recommendations for treatment or prevention of oc in children. amongst adults there were few studies per comparison. due to insufficient evidence no conclusion could be made about the effectiveness of clotrimazole nystatin amphotericin b itraconazole or ketoconazole with regard to oc prophylaxis. in comparison to placebo fluconazole is an effective preventative intervention. however the potential for resistant candida organisms to develop as well as the cost of prophylaxis might impact the feasibility of implementation. no studies were found comparing fluconazole with other interventions. the direction of findings suggests that ketoconazole fluconazole itraconazole and clotrimazole improved the treatment outcomes. implications for researchit is encouraging that low-cost alternatives are being tested but more research needs to be on in this area and on interventions like gentian violet and other less expensive anti-fungal drugs to treat oc. more well-designed treatment trials with larger samples are needed to allow for sufficient power to detect differences in not only clinical but also mycological response and relapse rates. there is also a strong need for more research to be done on the treatment and prevention of oc in children as it is reported that oc is the most frequent fungal infection in children and adolescents who are hiv positive. more research on the effectiveness of less expensive interventions also needs to be done in resource-poor settings. currently few trials report outcomes related to quality of life nutrition or survival. future researchers should consider measuring these when planning trials. development of resistance remains under-studied and more work must be done in this area. it is recommended that trials be more standardised and conform more closely to consort.

of locoregional recurrence but has no significant impact on cancer-related deaths or overall survival. it is associated with significant morbidity and a reduction in quality of life. there is no demonstrable survival advantage from adjuvant ebrt for high-risk stage i endometrial cancer however the meta-analyses of this subgroup were underpowered and also included high-intermediate risk women therefore we cannot exclude a small benefit in the high-risk subgroup. ebrt may have an adverse effect on endometrial cancer survival when used to treat uncomplicated low-risk ia/b grade 1/2 endometrial cancer. for the intermediate to high-intermediate risk group vbt alone appears to be adequate in ensuring vaginal control compared to ebrt. further research is needed to guide practice for

suit the needs of patients with different problems. patients presenting acutely to hospital with moderate to severe brain injury should be routinely followed up to assess their needs for rehabilitation. intensive intervention appears to lead to earlier gains. the balance between intensity and cost-effectiveness has yet to be determined. patients discharged from in-patient rehabilitation should have access to out-patient or community-based services appropriate to their needs. those with milder brain injury benefit from follow up and appropriate information and advice. not all questions in rehabilitation can be addressed by randomised controlled trials or other experimental approaches. some questions include which treatments work best for which patients over the long term and which models of service represent value for money in the context of life-long care. in future such questions will need to be set alongside practice-based evidence gathered from large systematic longitudinal cohort studies conducted in the context of routine clinical practice.

more effective than desmopressin or tricyclics because around half the children remain dry after alarm treatment stops. overlearning giving extra fluids at bedtime after successfully becoming dry using an alarm dry bed training and avoiding penalties may further reduce the relapse rate. better quality research comparing alarms with other treatments is needed including follow-up to determine relapse rates.

progesterone. overall the addition of other substances such as estrogen or hcg did not seem to improve outcomes. we also found no evidence favouring a specific route or duration of administration of progesterone. we found that hcg or hcg plus progesterone was associated with a higher risk of ohss. the use of hcg should therefore be avoided. there were significant results showing a benefit from addition of gnrh agonist to progesterone for the outcomes of live birth clinical pregnancy and ongoing pregnancy. for now progesterone seems to be the best option as luteal phase support with better pregnancy results when synthetic progesterone is used.

available evidence it is possible that pentoxifylline could have a place in the treatment of ic as a means of improving walking distance and as a complimentary treatment assuming all other essential measures such as lifestyle change exercise and treatment for secondary prevention have been taken into account. however the response to pentoxifylline should be assessed on an individual basis.

between the benefits of topical fluorides in caries prevention and the risk of the development of fluorosis. most of the available evidence focuses on mild fluorosis. there is weak unreliable evidence that starting the use of fluoride toothpaste in children under 12 months of age may be associated with an increased risk of fluorosis. the evidence for its use between the age of 12 and 24 months is equivocal. if the risk of fluorosis is of concern the fluoride level of toothpaste for young children under 6 years of age is recommended to be lower than 1000 parts per million ppm). more evidence with low risk of bias is needed. future trials assessing the effectiveness of different types of topical fluorides including toothpastes gels varnishes and mouthrinses or different concentrations or both should ensure that they include an adequate follow-up period in order to collect data on potential fluorosis. as it is unethical to propose rcts to assess fluorosis itself it is acknowledged that further observational studies will be undertaken in this area. however attention needs to be given to the choice of study design bearing in mind that prospective controlled studies will be less susceptible to bias than retrospective and/or uncontrolled studies.

unknown since only one trial addressed this issue. the use of standardized methods for assessing acne severity would help in synthesizing results across trials as well as aid in interpretation.

stools per week was low or very low due to sparse data inconsistency heterogeneity and high risk of bias in the studies in the pooled analyses. thus the results of the pooled analyses should be interpreted with caution because of quality and methodological concerns as well as clinical heterogeneity and short follow up. however peg appears safe and well tolerated. there is also evidence suggesting the efficacy of liquid paraffin mineral oil which was also well tolerated.there is no evidence to demonstrate the superiority of lactulose when compared to the other agents studied although there is a lack of placebo controlled studies. further research is needed to investigate the long term use of peg for childhood constipation as well as the role of liquid paraffin.

detection in patients suspected of having tb mdr-tb or hiv-associated tb is sensitive and specific. xpert may also be valuable as an add-on test following microscopy for patients who have previously been found to be smear-negative. an xpert result that is positive for rifampicin resistance should be carefully interpreted and take into consideration the risk of mdr-tb in a given patient and the expected prevalence of mdr-tb in a given setting. studies in this review mainly assessed sensitivity and specificity of the test when used in reference laboratories in research investigations. most studies were performed in high tb burden countries. ongoing use of xpert in high tb burden countries will contribute to the evidence base on the diagnostic accuracy and clinical impact of xpert in routine programmatic and peripheral health care settings including settings where the test is performed at the point of care.

shunt used. the benefit of its use after this period remains uncertain. however this data derives from the rate of shunt infection which is an intermediary outcome. future trials should evaluate the effectiveness of different regimens of systemic antibiotics rather than placebo and should include all-cause mortality shunt revision and adverse events as additional outcomes. evidence suggests that antibiotic-impregnated catheters reduce the incidence of shunt infection although more well-designed clinical trials testing the effect of antibiotic-impregnated shunts are required to confirm their net benefit.

intramedullary nailing has however a lower incidence of implant failure than unreamed nailing. low quality evidence suggests that reamed nailing may reduce the incidence of major re-operations related to non-union in closed fractures rather than in open fractures. low quality evidence suggests that the ender nail has poorer results in terms of re-operation and malunion than an interlocking nail.

technique over another in providing effective conscious sedation and analgesia for pain relief during and after oocyte recovery. the simultaneous use of more than one method of sedation and pain relief resulted in better pain relief than one modality alone. the various approaches and techniques reviewed appeared to be acceptable and were associated with a high degree of satisfaction in women. as women vary in their experience of pain and in coping strategies the optimal method may be individualised depending on the preferences of both the women and the clinicians and resource availability.

demonstrates that topiramate in a 100 mg/day dosage is effective in reducing headache frequency and reasonably well-tolerated in adult patients with episodic migraine. this provides good evidence to support its use in routine clinical management. more studies designed specifically to compare the efficacy or safety of topiramate versus other interventions with proven efficacy in the prophylaxis of migraine are needed.

clamping of the cord for at least two to three minutes seems not to increase the risk of postpartum haemorrhage. in addition late cord clamping can be advantageous for the infant by improving iron status which may be of clinical value particularly in infants where access to good nutrition is poor although delaying clamping increases the risk of jaundice requiring phototherapy.

insufficient to rule out the potential advantages for traction in particular for specific fracture types or to confirm additional complications due to traction use. given the increasing lack of evidence for the use of pre-operative traction the onus should now be on clinicians who persist in using pre-operative traction to either stop using it or to use it only in the context of a well-designed randomised controlled trial.
