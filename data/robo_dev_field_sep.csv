of donepezil is neither more nor less expensive compared with placebo when assessing total health care resource costs. benefits on the 10 mg/day dose were marginally larger than on the 5 mg/day dose. taking into consideration the better tolerability of the 5 mg/day donepezil compared with the 10 mg/day dose together with the lower cost the lower dose may be the better option. the debate on whether donepezil is effective continues despite the evidence of efficacy from the clinical studies because the treatment effects are small and are not always apparent in practice.

offers counselling sessions in addition to methadone thus the review actually did not evaluate the question of whether any ancillary psychosocial intervention is needed when methadone maintenance is provided but the narrower question of whether a specific more structured intervention provides any additional benefit to a standard psychosocial support. these interventions probably can be measured and evaluated by employing diverse criteria for evaluating treatment outcomes aimed to rigorously assess changes in emotional interpersonal vocational and physical health areas of life functioning.

statistically significant the differences between disc replacement and conventional fusion surgery for degenerative disc disease were not beyond the generally accepted clinical important differences

facet joint degeneration by using total disc replacement as noted by the manufacturers and distributors was not properly assessed and not a research question at all. unfortunately evidence from observational studies could not be used because of the high risk of bias while these could have improved external validity assessment of complications in less selected patient groups. non-randomised studies should however be very clear about patient selection and should incorporate independent blinded outcome assessment which was not the case in the excluded studies. therefore because we believe that harm and complications may occur after years we believe that the spine surgery community should be prudent about adopting this technology on a large scale despite the fact that total disc

information on another antidepressant venlafaxine. there is still limited evidence for the role of ssris. whether antidepressants prevent the development of neuropathic pain pre-emptive use is still unclear. both tcas and venlafaxine have nnts of approximately three. this means that for approximately every three patients with neuropathic pain who are treated with either of these antidepressants one will get at least moderate pain relief. there is evidence to suggest that other antidepressants may be effective but numbers of participants are insufficient to calculate robust nnts. ssris are generally better tolerated by patients and more high quality studies are required.

concealment of treatment allocation transfusion practices may have been influenced by knowledge of the patients treatment status potentially biasing the results in favour of cell salvage.

larger study were included. cranberry products were not significantly different to antibiotics for preventing utis in three small studies. given the large number of dropouts/withdrawals from studies mainly attributed to the acceptability of consuming cranberry products particularly juice over long periods and the evidence that the benefit for preventing uti is small cranberry juice cannot currently be recommended for the prevention of utis. other preparations such as powders need to be quantified using standardised methods to ensure the potency and contain enough of the active

antihypertensive therapy in general rather than beta-blocker therapy specifically results in greater benefit than risk for treatment of mild-moderate pregnancy hypertension. if so then it would be

the ssris and venlafaxine the routine use of benzodiazepines cannot be recommended especially given concerns of dependency and treatment related emergent adverse events associated with this class of

smoking cessation between two and threefold compared with pharmacologically unassisted quit attempts. lower dose regimens also conferred benefits for cessation while reducing the incidence of adverse events. more participants quit successfully with varenicline than with bupropion. two open-label trials of varenicline versus nrt suggested a modest benefit of varenicline but confidence intervals did not rule out equivalence. limited evidence suggests that varenicline may have a role to play in relapse prevention. the main adverse effect of varenicline is nausea but mostly at mild to moderate levels and tending to subside over time. possible links with serious adverse events including serious psychiatric or cardiovascular events cannot be ruled out. future trials of cytisine may test extended regimens and more intensive behavioural support. there is a need for further trials of the efficacy of varenicline treatment extended beyond 12 weeks.

by small sample sizes and an inability to pool data from different studies. in addition the inclusion of data from published trials only may have resulted in significant publication bias. based on published trial data oseltamivir reduces the incidence of acute otitis media in children aged one to five years but is associated with a significantly increased risk of vomiting. one study demonstrated that laninamivir octanoate was more effective than oseltamivir in shortening duration of illness in children with oseltamivir-resistant influenza a/h1n1. the benefit of oseltamivir and zanamivir in preventing the transmission of influenza in households is modest and based on weak evidence. however the clinical efficacy of neuraminidase inhibitors in at risk children is still uncertain. larger high-quality trials are needed with sufficient power to determine the efficacy of neuraminidase inhibitors in preventing serious complications of influenza such as pneumonia or hospital admission particularly in at risk groups.

children the ketogenic diet results in short to medium term benefits in seizure control the effects of which are comparable to modern antiepileptic drugs. however one study of long term outcome reports a high attrition rate for the diet. this would suggest that many children find the diet difficult to tolerate. the main reasons for drop-outs in the included studies included gastrointestinal side effects and dislike for the diet. we found just three studies on the use of the diet in adults and none of these were randomised. there has been less research involving other diets. we found one randomised study of reasonable quality of the atkins diet. this study showed similar benefits in seizure control with a less restrictive diet. for those with medically intractable epilepsy or those in whom surgery is unsuitable a ketogenic diet could improve seizure control but tolerability is poor. one observational study suggested that the atkins diet may have a similar effect on seizure control

on the basis of high quality evidence natalizumab and ifnß-1a rebif are superior to all other treatments for preventing clinical relapses in rrms in the short-term 24 months compared to placebo. moderate quality evidence supports a protective effect of natalizumab and ifnß-1a rebif against disability progression in rrms in the short-term compared to placebo. these treatments are associated with long-term serious adverse events and their benefit-risk balance might be unfavourable. ifnß-1b betaseron and mitoxantrone probably decreased the odds of the participants with rrms having relapses compared with placebo moderate quality of evidence). the benefit-risk balance with azathioprine is uncertain however this agent might be effective in decreasing the odds of the participants with rrms having relapses and disability progression over 24 to 36 months compared with placebo. the lack of convincing efficacy data shows that ifnß-1a avonex intravenous immunoglobulins cyclophosphamide and long-term steroids have an unfavourable benefit-risk balance in rrms. none of the included treatments are effective in decreasing disability progression in patients with progressive ms. it is important to consider that the clinical effects of all these treatments beyond two years are uncertain a relevant point for a disease of 30 to 40 years duration. direct head-to-head comparison(s between natalizumab and ifnß-1a rebif or between azathioprine and ifnß-1a rebif should be top priority on the research agenda and follow-up of the trial cohorts should be mandatory.

combination of laba and ics is modestly more effective in reducing the risk of exacerbations requiring oral corticosteroids than a higher dose of ics. combination therapy also led to modestly greater improvement in lung function symptoms and use of rescue ß2 agonists and to fewer withdrawals due to poor asthma control than with a higher dose of inhaled corticosteroids. apart from an increased rate of tremor and less oral candidiasis with combination therapy the two options appear relatively safe in adults although adverse effects associated with long-term ics treatment were seldom monitored. in children combination therapy did not lead to a significant reduction but rather a trend towards an increased risk of oral steroid-treated exacerbations and hospital admissions. these trends raised concern about the safety of combination therapy in view of modest improvement in children under the age of 12 years.

radiotherapy techniques and more dose intensive accelerated and or hyperfractionated radiotherapy regimens.

in patients with ckd who were treated with iv iron compared with oral iron. from a limited body of evidence we identified a significant reduction in esa requirements in patients treated with iv iron and found no significant difference in mortality. adverse effects were reported in only 50 of included studies. we therefore suggest that further studies that focus on patient-centred outcomes are needed to determine if the use of iv iron is justified on the basis of reductions in esa dose and cost improvements in patient quality of life and with few serious adverse effects.

effective interventions for chronic pelvic pain remains limited and recommendations are based largely on single studies. given the prevalence and healthcare costs associated with chronic pelvic pain in women randomised controlled trials of other medical surgical and psychological interventions are urgently required.chronic pelvic pain is common in women in the reproductive and older age groups and it causes disability and distress that result in significant costs to health services. the pathogenesis of chronic pelvic pain is poorly understood. often investigation by laparoscopy reveals no obvious cause for the pain. there are several possible explanations for chronic pelvic pain including undetected irritable bowel syndrome and central sensitisation of the nervous system. a vascular hypothesis proposes that pain arises from dilated pelvic veins in which blood flow is markedly reduced. as the pathophysiology of chronic pelvic pain is not well understood its treatment is often unsatisfactory and limited to symptom relief. currently the main approaches to treatment include counselling or psychotherapy attempts to provide reassurance using laparoscopy to exclude serious pathology progestogen therapy such as with medroxyprogesterone acetate and surgery to interrupt nerve pathways.

reduces transmission of malaria. in individual patients it reduces gametocyte prevalence and density. in practical terms even if pq results in large reductions in gametocytes in people being treated for malaria there is no reliable evidence that this will reduce transmission in a malaria-endemic community where many people are infected but have no symptoms and are unlikely to be treated. since pq is acting as a monotherapy against gametocytes there is a risk of the parasite developing resistance to the drug. in terms of harms there is insufficient evidence from trials to know whether the drug can be used safely in this way in populations where g6pd deficiency occurs. in light of these doubts about safety and lack of evidence of any benefit in reducing transmission countries should question whether to continue to use pq routinely in primary treatment of malaria. further synthesis of observational data on safety and new trials may help elucidate a role for pq in malaria elimination or in situations where most infected individuals are symptomatic and receive treatment.

of oral naltrexone treatment in the field of opioid dependence. consequently maintenance therapy with naltrexone cannot yet be considered a treatment which has been scientifically proved to be superior to other kinds of treatment.

greater effect on probing measures of periodontal treatment than open flap debridement including improved attachment gain reduced pocket depth less increase in gingival recession and more gain in hard tissue probing at re-entry surgery. however there is marked variability between studies and the clinical relevance of these changes is unknown. as a result it is difficult to draw general conclusions about the clinical benefit of gtr. whilst there is evidence that gtr can demonstrate a significant improvement over conventional open flap surgery the factors affecting outcomes are unclear from the literature and these might include study conduct issues such as bias. therefore patients and health professionals need to consider the predictability of the technique compared with other methods of treatment before making final decisions on use. since trial reports were often incomplete we recommend that future trials should follow the consort statement both in their conduct and reporting. there is therefore little value in future research repeating simple small efficacy studies. the priority should be to identify factors associated with improved outcomes as well as investigating outcomes relevant to patients. types of research might include large observational studies to generate hypotheses for testing in clinical trials qualitative studies on patient-centred outcomes and trials exploring innovative analytic methods such as multilevel modelling. open flap surgery should remain the control comparison in these studies.

years one will avoid dying of breast cancer and 10 healthy women who would not have been diagnosed if there had not been screening will be treated unnecessarily. furthermore more than 200 women will experience important psychological distress including anxiety and uncertainty for years because of false positive findings. to help ensure that the women are fully informed before they decide whether or not to attend screening we have written an evidence-based leaflet for lay people that is available in several languages on www.cochrane.dk. because of substantial advances in treatment and greater breast cancer awareness since the trials were carried out it is likely that the absolute effect of screening today is smaller than in the trials. recent observational studies show more overdiagnosis

evidence for any of the treatments in terms of curing chronic blepharitis. commercial products are marketed to consumers and prescribed to patients without substantial evidence of effectiveness. further research is needed to evaluate the effectiveness of such treatments. any rct designed for this purpose should separate participants by type of condition e.g. staphylococcal blepharitis or mgd in order to minimize imbalances between groups type i errors and to achieve statistical power for analyses prevent type ii errors). medical interventions and commercial products should be compared with conventional lid hygiene measures such as warm compresses and eyelid margin washing to determine effectiveness as well as head-to-head to show comparative effectiveness between treatments. outcomes of interest should be patient-centered and measured using validated questionnaires or scales. it is important that participants be followed long-term at least one year to assess chronic outcomes properly.

review indicate that the number of systemic and topical drugs used for the different subforms of pruritus is increasing. different interventions have been shown to be effective in the treatment of pruritus of different origins. nevertheless an optimal therapy for pruritus is constrained due to the limited understanding of crucial itch mediators and receptors in the various subforms of itch. ideal antipruritic therapies are still lacking especially for palliative care patients. this systematic review also indicates that there is insufficient evidence to give any concrete recommendations regarding treatment of pruritus in palliative care patients. due to the very small sample sizes and poor methodological quality of the majority of studies that were included the results of this review need to be interpreted with caution. furthermore the generalizability is questionable. additional studies and particularly carefully designed treatment trials are needed to provide valid evidence for adequate treatment of pruritus in palliative care patients.

prophylaxis for these patients preferably with a quinolone. prophylaxis may also be considered for patients with solid tumours or lymphoma.

symptom recurrence and the need for additional operations compared to conventional excisional hemorrhoid surgeries. patients should be informed of these risks when being offered the stapled hemorrhoidopexy as surgical therapy. if hemorrhoid recurrence and prolapse are the most important clinical outcomes then conventional excisional surgery remains the gold standard in the surgical treatment of internal hemorrhoids.

population can work and should be supported. results of previous studies provide a benchmark for expectations in new studies. meta-analysis can inform future design and implementation in terms of sample size target populations settings goals for process measures and intervention content. when effects differ by design variables which are deliberately selected and planned awareness of these characteristics may be beneficial to future designs. researchers designing future small group and individual-level studies should keep in mind that to date effects of the greatest magnitude have been observed in studies that used count outcomes and a shorter intervention span up to 1 month). among small group and individual-level studies effects were also greatest when the comparison condition included minimal to no hiv prevention content. nevertheless statistically significant favorable effects were also seen when the comparison condition included standard or other hiv prevention content. researchers choosing the latter option for new studies should plan for larger sample sizes based on the smaller expected net intervention effect noted above. when effects differ by implementation variables which become evident as the study is conducted but are not usually selected or planned caution may be advised so that future studies can reduce bias. because intervention effects were somewhat stronger though not statistically significantly so in studies with a greater attrition in the comparison condition differential retention may be a threat to validity. extra effort should be given to retaining participants in comparison conditions. among community-level interventions intervention effects were strongest among studies with random assignment of groups or communities. therefore the inclusion of studies where assignment of groups or communities was by convenience did not exaggerate the summary effect. the greater effectiveness of interventions including more than 25 non-gay identifying msm suggests that when they can be reached these men may be more responsive than gay-identified men to risk reduction efforts. non-gay identified msm may have had less exposure to previous prevention messages so their initial exposure may have a greater impact. the greater effectiveness of interventions that include efforts to promote personal skills such as keeping condoms available and behavioral self-management indicates that such content merits strong consideration in development and delivery of new interventions for msm. and the finding that interventions were most effective for majority white populations underscores the critical need for effective interventions for msm of african and latino descent. further research measuring the incidence of hiv and other stds is needed. because most studies were conducted among mostly white men in the us and europe more evaluations of interventions are needed for african american and hispanic msm as well as msm in the developing world. more research is also needed to further clarify which behavioral strategies e.g. reducing unprotected anal sex having oral sex instead of anal sex reducing number of partners avoiding serodiscordant partners strategic positioning or reducing anal sex even with condom use are most effective in reducing transmission among msm the messages most effective in promoting these behaviors and the methods and settings in which these messages can be most effectively delivered.

targeted to children aged six to 12 years. however given the unexplained heterogeneity and the likelihood of small study bias these findings must be interpreted cautiously. a broad range of programme components were used in these studies and whilst it is not possible to distinguish which of these components contributed most to the beneficial effects observed our synthesis indicates the following to be promising policies and strategies · school curriculum that includes healthy eating physical activity and body image · increased sessions for physical activity and the development of fundamental movement skills throughout the school week · improvements in nutritional quality of the food supply in schools · environments and cultural practices that support children eating healthier foods and being active throughout each day · support for teachers and other staff to implement health promotion strategies and activities e.g. professional development capacity building activities · parent support and home activities that encourage children to be more active eat more nutritious foods and spend less time in screen based activities however study and evaluation designs need to be strengthened and reporting extended to capture process and implementation factors outcomes in relation to measures of equity longer term outcomes potential harms and costs. childhood obesity prevention research must now move towards identifying how effective intervention components can be embedded within health education and care systems and achieve long term sustainable impacts.

placebos used in trials. oral bo and epo are not effective treatments for eczema. in these studies along with the placebos epo and bo have the same fairly common mild transient adverse effects which are mainly gastrointestinal. the short-term studies included here do not examine possible adverse effects of long-term use of epo or bo. a case report warned that if epo is taken for a prolonged period of time more than one year there is a potential risk of inflammation thrombosis and immunosuppression another study found that epo may increase bleeding for people on coumadin® warfarin medication. implications for research noting that the confidence intervals between active and placebo treatment are narrow to exclude the possibility of any clinically useful difference we concluded that further studies on epo or bo for eczema would be hard to justify. this review does not provide information about long-term use of these products.
