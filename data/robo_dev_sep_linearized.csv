ptsd symptoms as significantly. there was some evidence that individual tfcbt and emdr are superior to stress management in the treatment of ptsd at between 2 and 5 months following treatment and also that tfcbt emdr and stress management were more effective than other therapies. there was insufficient evidence to determine whether psychological treatment is harmful. there was some evidence of greater drop-out in active treatment groups. the considerable unexplained heterogeneity observed in these comparisons and the potential impact of publication bias on these data suggest the need for caution in interpreting the results of this review.

clinicians rated global clinical state more positively in treated patients and measured less decline in measures of global disease severity. there is some evidence that use of donepezil is neither more nor less expensive compared with placebo when assessing total health care resource costs. benefits on the 10 mg/day dose were marginally larger than on the 5 mg/day dose. taking into consideration the better tolerability of the 5 mg/day donepezil compared with the 10 mg/day dose together with the lower cost the lower dose may be the better option. the debate on whether donepezil is effective continues despite the evidence of efficacy from the clinical studies because the treatment effects are small and are not always apparent in practice.

the control intervention used in the studies included in the review on maintenance treatments is a program that routinely offers counselling sessions in addition to methadone thus the review actually did not evaluate the question of whether any ancillary psychosocial intervention is needed when methadone maintenance is provided but the narrower question of whether a specific more structured intervention provides any additional benefit to a standard psychosocial support. these interventions probably can be measured and evaluated by employing diverse criteria for evaluating treatment outcomes aimed to rigorously assess changes in emotional interpersonal vocational and physical health areas of life functioning.

generally accepted clinical important differences with respect to short-term pain relief disability and quality of life. moreover these analyses only represent a highly selected population. the primary goal of prevention of adjacent level disease and facet joint degeneration by using total disc replacement as noted by the manufacturers and distributors was not properly assessed and not a research question at all. unfortunately evidence from observational studies could not be used because of the high risk of bias while these could have improved external validity assessment of complications in less selected patient groups. non-randomised studies should however be very clear about patient selection and should incorporate independent blinded outcome assessment which was not the case in the excluded studies. therefore because we believe that harm and complications may occur after years we believe that the spine surgery community should be prudent about adopting this technology on a large scale despite the fact that total disc replacement seems to be effective in treating low-back pain in selected patients and in the short term is at least equivalent to fusion surgery.

effectiveness of antidepressants for neuropathic pain and has provided new information on another antidepressant venlafaxine. there is still limited evidence for the role of ssris. whether antidepressants prevent the development of neuropathic pain pre-emptive use is still unclear. both tcas and venlafaxine have nnts of approximately three. this means that for approximately every three patients with neuropathic pain who are treated with either of these antidepressants one will get at least moderate pain relief. there is evidence to suggest that other antidepressants may be effective but numbers of participants are insufficient to calculate robust nnts. ssris are generally better tolerated by patients and more high quality studies are required.

include a greater focus on hpv and its link to cervical cancer with long-term follow-up to assess impact on behaviour change rates of hpv infection and progression to cervical cancer. studies should use an rct design where possible with integral process evaluation and cost-effectiveness analysis where appropriate. given the predominance of usa studies in this systematic review evaluations conducted in other countries would be particularly useful.

transfusion in adult elective cardiac and orthopaedic surgery. the use of cell salvage did not appear to impact adversely on clinical outcomes. however the methodological quality of trials was poor. as the trials were unblinded and lacked adequate concealment of treatment allocation transfusion practices may have been influenced by knowledge of the patients treatment status potentially biasing the results in favour of cell salvage.

the distal anastomosis site improves primary graft patency rates for below knee ptfe graft but this does not reduce the risk of limb loss. evidence for this beneficial effect of vein cuffed ptfe grafts is weak and based on an underpowered trial. pre-cuffed ptfe grafts have comparable patency and limb salvage rates to vein cuff ptfe grafts. the use of spliced veins improved secondary patency

also evidence to suggest that combination therapy with anticholinergic therapy increased the efficacy of other established therapies such as imipramine desmopressin and enuresis alarms by reducing the relapse rates by about 20 although it was not possible to identify the characteristics of children who would benefit from combination therapy. future studies should evaluate the role of combination therapy against established treatments in rigorous and adequately powered trials.

clinically relevant. appropriately designed trials of adequate power are therefore warranted.

demonstrated a small benefit for women with recurrent utis there were no statistically significant differences when the results of a much larger study were included. cranberry products were not significantly different to antibiotics for preventing utis in three small studies. given the large number of dropouts/withdrawals from studies mainly attributed to the acceptability of consuming cranberry products particularly juice over long periods and the evidence that the benefit for preventing uti is small cranberry juice cannot currently be recommended for the prevention of utis. other

were reflected in substantive benefits for mother and/or baby and none have been clearly demonstrated. the effect of beta-blockers on perinatal outcome is uncertain the worrying trend to an increase in sga infants is partly dependent on one small outlying trial. large randomised trials are needed to determine whether antihypertensive therapy in general rather than beta-blocker therapy specifically results in greater benefit than risk for treatment of mild-moderate pregnancy hypertension. if so then it would be appropriate to consider which antihypertensive is best and beta-blockers should be evaluated. note the seventeen reports in the awaiting classification section of the review may alter the conclusions of the review once assessed.

maybe superior to alternatives in some settings. however we were unable to draw firm general conclusions on comparative contemporary effectiveness given that resistance changes over time and many

gatifloxacin remains effective in some regions where resistance to older fluoroquinolones has developed. however the different fluoroquinolones have not been compared directly in trials in these

in paediatric anxiety disorders acting to reduce core symptoms and should be considered as part of the treatment of these disorders. the greatest number of trials showing efficacy to date have assessed the ssris in treating paediatric ocd. there is no clear evidence to show that any particular class of medication is more effective or better tolerated than any other. as quantitative data was only available for the ssris and venlafaxine the routine use of benzodiazepines cannot be recommended especially given concerns of dependency and treatment related emergent adverse events associated with this class of drugs. future rcts could help identify potential clinical moderators of treatment efficacy. studies of the long-term efficacy of medication treatment optimal dosage as well as direct comparisons of pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy are also warranted.

interventions unsuited to primary care or population prevention programmes provide only minimal reductions in blood pressure during long-term trials. further evaluations to assess effects on morbidity and mortality outcomes are needed for populations as a whole and for patients with elevated blood pressure. a low sodium diet may help in maintenance of lower blood pressure following withdrawal of antihypertensives. if this is confirmed with no increase in cardiovascular events then targeting of comprehensive dietary and behavioural programmes in patients with elevated blood pressure requiring drug treatment would be justified.

although absolute quit rates were modest in two recent trials. varenicline at standard dose increased the chances of successful long-term smoking cessation between two and threefold compared with pharmacologically unassisted quit attempts. lower dose regimens also conferred benefits for cessation while reducing the incidence of adverse events. more participants quit successfully with varenicline than with bupropion. two open-label trials of varenicline versus nrt suggested a modest benefit of varenicline but confidence intervals did not rule out equivalence. limited evidence suggests that varenicline may have a role to play in relapse prevention. the main adverse effect of varenicline is nausea but mostly at mild to moderate levels and tending to subside over time.

on these interventions should have larger patient samples and include more precise standardization and description of all treatment characteristics.

in children with influenza. however our analysis was limited by small sample sizes and an inability to pool data from different studies. in addition the inclusion of data from published trials only may have resulted in significant publication bias. based on published trial data oseltamivir reduces the incidence of acute otitis media in children aged one to five years but is associated with a significantly increased risk of vomiting. one study demonstrated that laninamivir octanoate was more effective than oseltamivir in shortening duration of illness in children with oseltamivir-resistant influenza a/h1n1. the benefit of oseltamivir and zanamivir in preventing the transmission of influenza in households is modest and based on weak evidence. however the clinical efficacy of neuraminidase inhibitors in at risk children is still uncertain. larger high-quality trials are needed with sufficient power to determine the efficacy of neuraminidase inhibitors in preventing serious complications of influenza such as pneumonia or hospital admission particularly in at risk groups.

significantly influenced by any drug. no promising results are available for the core bpd symptoms of chronic feelings of emptiness identity disturbance and abandonment. conclusions have to be drawn

studies of the ketogenic diet. although none were blinded some were of good quality. these studies suggest that in children the ketogenic diet results in short to medium term benefits in seizure control the effects of which are comparable to modern antiepileptic drugs. however one study of long term outcome reports a high attrition rate for the diet. this would suggest that many children find the diet difficult to tolerate. the main reasons for drop-outs in the included studies included gastrointestinal side effects and dislike for the diet. we found just three studies on the use of the diet in adults and none of these were randomised. there has been less research involving other diets. we found one randomised study of reasonable quality of the atkins diet. this study showed similar benefits in seizure control with a less restrictive diet. for those with medically intractable epilepsy or those in whom surgery is unsuitable a ketogenic diet could improve seizure control but tolerability is poor. one observational study suggested that the atkins diet may have a similar effect on seizure control but this requires more investigation.

the basis of high quality evidence natalizumab and ifnß-1a rebif are superior to all other treatments for preventing clinical relapses in rrms in the short-term 24 months compared to placebo. moderate quality evidence supports a protective effect of natalizumab and ifnß-1a rebif against disability progression in rrms in the short-term compared to placebo. these treatments are associated with long-term serious adverse events and their benefit-risk balance might be unfavourable. ifnß-1b betaseron and mitoxantrone probably decreased the odds of the participants with rrms having relapses compared with placebo moderate quality of evidence). the benefit-risk balance with azathioprine is uncertain however this agent might be effective in decreasing the odds of the participants with rrms having relapses and disability progression over 24 to 36 months compared with placebo. the lack of convincing efficacy data shows that ifnß-1a avonex intravenous immunoglobulins cyclophosphamide and long-term steroids have an unfavourable benefit-risk balance in rrms. none of the included treatments are effective in decreasing disability progression in patients with progressive ms. it is important to consider that the clinical effects of all these treatments beyond two years are uncertain a relevant point for a disease of 30 to 40 years duration. direct head-to-head comparison(s between natalizumab and ifnß-1a rebif or between azathioprine and ifnß-1a rebif should be top priority on the research agenda and follow-up of the trial cohorts should be mandatory.

adolescents and adults with sub-optimal control on low dose ics monotherapy the combination of laba and ics is modestly more effective in reducing the risk of exacerbations requiring oral corticosteroids than a higher dose of ics. combination therapy also led to modestly greater improvement in lung function symptoms and use of rescue ß2 agonists and to fewer withdrawals due to poor asthma control than with a higher dose of inhaled corticosteroids. apart from an increased rate of tremor and less oral candidiasis with combination therapy the two options appear relatively safe in adults although adverse effects associated with long-term ics treatment were seldom monitored. in children combination therapy did not lead to a significant reduction but rather a trend towards an increased risk of oral steroid-treated exacerbations and hospital admissions. these trends raised concern about the safety of combination therapy in view of modest improvement in children under the age of 12 years.

or sequential chemoradiotherapy. patient selection is an important consideration in view of the added toxicity of concurrent treatment. uncertainty remains as to how far this is purely due to a radiosensitising effect and whether similar benefits could be achieved by using modern radiotherapy techniques and more dose intensive accelerated and or hyperfractionated radiotherapy regimens.

the magnitude of the effect seen with azathioprine etretinate oral low dose methotrexate and perhaps colchicine suggests that they may be effective but that further multicentre clinical trials are required to establish their efficacy. furthermore the magnitude of the improvement observed in the placebo group strongly suggests that uncontrolled trials should not be used to guide management decisions in this condition.

role for minimally invasive surgery i.e. laparoscopy was found. furthermore protocol compliance within eras programs has not been investigated while this seems a known problem in the field. therefore more specific and large rct's are needed.

for increased ferritin and transferrin saturation levels together with a small increase in haemoglobin in patients with ckd who were treated with iv iron compared with oral iron. from a limited body of evidence we identified a significant reduction in esa requirements in patients treated with iv iron and found no significant difference in mortality. adverse effects were reported in only 50 of included studies. we therefore suggest that further studies that focus on patient-centred outcomes are needed to determine if the use of iv iron is justified on the basis of reductions in esa dose and cost improvements in patient quality of life and with few serious adverse effects.

effective interventions for chronic pelvic pain remains limited and recommendations are based largely on single studies. given the prevalence and healthcare costs associated with chronic pelvic pain in women randomised controlled trials of other medical surgical and psychological interventions are urgently required.chronic pelvic pain is common in women in the reproductive and older age groups and it causes disability and distress that result in significant costs to health services. the pathogenesis of chronic pelvic pain is poorly understood. often investigation by laparoscopy reveals no obvious cause for the pain. there are several possible explanations for chronic pelvic pain including undetected irritable bowel syndrome and central sensitisation of the nervous system. a vascular hypothesis proposes that pain arises from dilated pelvic veins in which blood flow is markedly reduced. as the pathophysiology of chronic pelvic pain is not well understood its treatment is often unsatisfactory and limited to symptom relief. currently the main approaches to treatment include counselling or psychotherapy attempts to provide reassurance using laparoscopy to exclude serious pathology progestogen therapy such as with medroxyprogesterone acetate and surgery to interrupt nerve pathways.

progestin type as well as estrogen dose. higher follow-up rates are essential for meaningful interpretation of results.

added to treatment regimens for patients with p. falciparum infection reduces transmission of malaria. in individual patients it reduces gametocyte prevalence and density. in practical terms even if pq results in large reductions in gametocytes in people being treated for malaria there is no reliable evidence that this will reduce transmission in a malaria-endemic community where many people are infected but have no symptoms and are unlikely to be treated. since pq is acting as a monotherapy against gametocytes there is a risk of the parasite developing resistance to the drug. in terms of harms there is insufficient evidence from trials to know whether the drug can be used safely in this way in populations where g6pd deficiency occurs. in light of these doubts about safety and lack of evidence of any benefit in reducing transmission countries should question whether to continue to use pq routinely in primary treatment of malaria. further synthesis of observational data on safety and new trials may help elucidate a role for pq in malaria elimination or in situations where most infected individuals are symptomatic and receive treatment.

reduced pocket depth less increase in gingival recession and more gain in hard tissue probing at re-entry surgery. however there is marked variability between studies and the clinical relevance of these changes is unknown. as a result it is difficult to draw general conclusions about the clinical benefit of gtr. whilst there is evidence that gtr can demonstrate a significant improvement over conventional open flap surgery the factors affecting outcomes are unclear from the literature and these might include study conduct issues such as bias. therefore patients and health professionals need to consider the predictability of the technique compared with other methods of treatment before making final decisions on use. since trial reports were often incomplete we recommend that future trials should follow the consort statement both in their conduct and reporting. there is therefore little value in future research repeating simple small efficacy studies. the priority should be to identify factors associated with improved outcomes as well as investigating outcomes relevant to patients. types of research might include large observational studies to generate hypotheses for testing in clinical trials qualitative studies on patient-centred outcomes and trials exploring innovative analytic methods such as multilevel modelling. open flap surgery should remain the control comparison in these studies.

throughout 10 years one will avoid dying of breast cancer and 10 healthy women who would not have been diagnosed if there had not been screening will be treated unnecessarily. furthermore more than 200 women will experience important psychological distress including anxiety and uncertainty for years because of false positive findings. to help ensure that the women are fully informed before they decide whether or not to attend screening we have written an evidence-based leaflet for lay people that is available in several languages on www.cochrane.dk. because of substantial advances in treatment and greater breast cancer awareness since the trials were carried out it is likely that the absolute effect of screening today is smaller than in the trials. recent observational studies show more overdiagnosis than in the trials and very little or no reduction in the incidence of advanced cancers with screening.

purpose should separate participants by type of condition e.g. staphylococcal blepharitis or mgd in order to minimize imbalances between groups type i errors and to achieve statistical power for analyses prevent type ii errors). medical interventions and commercial products should be compared with conventional lid hygiene measures such as warm compresses and eyelid margin washing to determine effectiveness as well as head-to-head to show comparative effectiveness between treatments. outcomes of interest should be patient-centered and measured using validated questionnaires or scales. it is important that participants be followed long-term at least one year to assess chronic outcomes properly.

indicate that the number of systemic and topical drugs used for the different subforms of pruritus is increasing. different interventions have been shown to be effective in the treatment of pruritus of different origins. nevertheless an optimal therapy for pruritus is constrained due to the limited understanding of crucial itch mediators and receptors in the various subforms of itch. ideal antipruritic therapies are still lacking especially for palliative care patients. this systematic review also indicates that there is insufficient evidence to give any concrete recommendations regarding treatment of pruritus in palliative care patients. due to the very small sample sizes and poor methodological quality of the majority of studies that were included the results of this review need to be interpreted with caution. furthermore the generalizability is questionable. additional studies and particularly carefully designed treatment trials are needed to provide valid evidence for adequate treatment of pruritus in palliative care patients.

in our review the most significant reduction in mortality was observed in trials assessing prophylaxis with quinolones. the benefits of antibiotic prophylaxis outweighed the harm such as adverse effects and the development of resistance since all-cause mortality was reduced. as most trials in our review were of patients with haematologic cancer we strongly recommend antibiotic prophylaxis for these patients preferably with a quinolone. prophylaxis may also be considered for patients with solid tumours or lymphoma.

a higher likelihood of long-term symptom recurrence and the need for additional operations compared to conventional excisional hemorrhoid surgeries. patients should be informed of these risks when being offered the stapled hemorrhoidopexy as surgical therapy. if hemorrhoid recurrence and prolapse are the most important clinical outcomes then conventional excisional surgery remains the gold standard in the surgical treatment of internal hemorrhoids.

sex among msm. these results indicate that hiv prevention for this population can work and should be supported. results of previous studies provide a benchmark for expectations in new studies. meta-analysis can inform future design and implementation in terms of sample size target populations settings goals for process measures and intervention content. when effects differ by design variables which are deliberately selected and planned awareness of these characteristics may be beneficial to future designs. researchers designing future small group and individual-level studies should keep in mind that to date effects of the greatest magnitude have been observed in studies that used count outcomes and a shorter intervention span up to 1 month). among small group and individual-level studies effects were also greatest when the comparison condition included minimal to no hiv prevention content. nevertheless statistically significant favorable effects were also seen when the comparison condition included standard or other hiv prevention content. researchers choosing the latter option for new studies should plan for larger sample sizes based on the smaller expected net intervention effect noted above. when effects differ by implementation variables which become evident as the study is conducted but are not usually selected or planned caution may be advised so that future studies can reduce bias. because intervention effects were somewhat stronger though not statistically significantly so in studies with a greater attrition in the comparison condition differential retention may be a threat to validity. extra effort should be given to retaining participants in comparison conditions. among community-level interventions intervention effects were strongest among studies with random assignment of groups or communities. therefore the inclusion of studies where assignment of groups or communities was by convenience did not exaggerate the summary effect. the greater effectiveness of interventions including more than 25 non-gay identifying msm suggests that when they can be reached these men may be more responsive than gay-identified men to risk reduction efforts. non-gay identified msm may have had less exposure to previous prevention messages so their initial exposure may have a greater impact. the greater effectiveness of interventions that include efforts to promote personal skills such as keeping condoms available and behavioral self-management indicates that such content merits strong consideration in development and delivery of new interventions for msm. and the finding that interventions were most effective for majority white populations underscores the critical need for effective interventions for msm of african and latino descent. further research measuring the incidence of hiv and other stds is needed. because most studies were conducted among mostly white men in the us and europe more evaluations of interventions are needed for african american and hispanic msm as well as msm in the developing world. more research is also needed to further clarify which behavioral strategies e.g. reducing unprotected anal sex having oral sex instead of anal sex reducing number of partners avoiding serodiscordant partners strategic positioning or reducing anal sex even with condom use are most effective in reducing transmission among msm the messages most effective in promoting these behaviors and the methods and settings in which these messages can be most effectively delivered.

targeted to children aged six to 12 years. however given the unexplained heterogeneity and the likelihood of small study bias these findings must be interpreted cautiously. a broad range of programme components were used in these studies and whilst it is not possible to distinguish which of these components contributed most to the beneficial effects observed our synthesis indicates the following to be promising policies and strategies · school curriculum that includes healthy eating physical activity and body image · increased sessions for physical activity and the development of fundamental movement skills throughout the school week · improvements in nutritional quality of the food supply in schools · environments and cultural practices that support children eating healthier foods and being active throughout each day · support for teachers and other staff to implement health promotion strategies and activities e.g. professional development capacity building activities · parent support and home activities that encourage children to be more active eat more nutritious foods and spend less time in screen based activities however study and evaluation designs need to be strengthened and reporting extended to capture process and implementation factors outcomes in relation to measures of equity longer term outcomes potential harms and costs. childhood obesity prevention research must now move towards identifying how effective intervention components can be embedded within health education and care systems and achieve long term sustainable impacts.

treatments for eczema. in these studies along with the placebos epo and bo have the same fairly common mild transient adverse effects which are mainly gastrointestinal. the short-term studies included here do not examine possible adverse effects of long-term use of epo or bo. a case report warned that if epo is taken for a prolonged period of time more than one year there is a potential risk of inflammation thrombosis and immunosuppression another study found that epo may increase bleeding for people on coumadin® warfarin medication. implications for research noting that the confidence intervals between active and placebo treatment are narrow to exclude the possibility of any clinically useful difference we concluded that further studies on epo or bo for eczema would be hard to justify. this review does not provide information about long-term use of these products.
